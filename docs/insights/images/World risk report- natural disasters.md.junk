##  World risk report: natural Disasters
   nsurance, infrastructure \| Homeland Security Newswire](https://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/dr20240909-world-risk-report-where-are-natural-disasters-most-common)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, drought, frequent<br> typhoons and floods: [in the<br> Philippines](https://www.dw.com/en/philippines/t-17363433), natural disasters are almost a part of everyday life. Most<br> recently, [Typhoon Yagi](https://www.dw.com/en/chinas-south-braces-for-super-typhoon-yagi/a-70137972), locally called Enteng, has caused rivers to<br> flood their banks and set off landslides, killing at least 15 people. This is<br> the fifth typhoon to lash the Philippines since May.  <br> Katrin Radtke, a senior researcher specializing in<br> disaster preparedness at the Ruhr University Bochum in Germany, said the<br> Philippines is rated as a “very high risk” country. She is the scientific<br> lead of the annual World Risk Report, published jointly by the Institute<br> for International Law of Peace and Armed Conflict and an alliance of<br> nine German development organizations, Bündnis Entwicklung Hilft. The<br> technical report has a [World Risk Index](https://www.ifhv.de/publications/world-risk-report "External link — World Risk Index"), which breaks<br> down the disaster risk of 193 countries.  <br> The Philippines tops this year’s ranking of high-risk<br> countries, followed by [Indonesia](https://www.dw.com/en/indonesia/t-63713737), [India](https://www.dw.com/en/india/t-18996071), [Colombia](https://www.dw.com/en/colombia/t-65449216),<br> and [Mexico](https://www.dw.com/en/mexico/t-18214018).<br> “These countries are affected by extreme natural disasters that are very<br> frequent and have a high intensity,” Radtke told DW. “We call this a<br> high exposure.”  <br> But the frequency and intensity of storms, earthquakes<br> and [droughts](https://www.dw.com/en/heat-and-drought/t-19024671) are not the only decisive factors — another<br> is a country’s vulnerability to natural disasters. “That’s the case when<br> societies have little means to face such natural hazards. Sometimes that’s<br> because they are poor, for example, or have high levels of corruption, or<br> poor health care, or inadequate disaster preparedness,” she said.  <br> When it comes to the most vulnerable countries, according<br> to the World Risk Index, eight of the 10 are on the African continent.<br> The remaining two, [Afghanistan](https://www.dw.com/en/afghanistan/t-18932080) and [Yemen](https://www.dw.com/en/yemen/t-38381376), have<br> been exhausted by war for decades. In such countries, there may be fewer<br> health providers and hospital beds, for example, meaning more people are<br> likely to die in the case of a natural disaster.  <br> **Vulnerability Can Be Reduced<br>** But if a country invests in disaster preparedness, a natural hazard does<br> not necessarily lead to a catastrophic impact for many people. This explains<br> why wealthy countries like the [United States](https://www.dw.com/en/united-states-of-america/t-19065189) or [Australia](https://www.dw.com/en/australia/t-18172340) aren’t<br> ranked higher in the World Risk Index, despite their high exposure to natural<br> disasters such as drought, [earthquakes](https://www.dw.com/en/earthquakes/t-64654029) and storms.  <br> “[China](https://www.dw.com/en/china/t-18480887) has shown that lessons can be drawn from<br> crises and catastrophes, thereby reducing the nation’s overall disaster<br> risk,” said Radtke. The country currently scores 22nd on the World Risk<br> Index — that’s 12 places better than last year.  <br> “Mostly, that’s because China was able to markedly<br> reduce its vulnerability in response to the [COVID-19<br> pandemic](https://www.dw.com/en/covid-19/t-62123668),” she explained, pointing out that the Chinese government<br> invested heavily in its health care system, building new hospitals and<br> launching large-scale vaccination campaigns, among other things.  <br> “But what we cannot depict on our World Risk Index is the<br> fact that this also happened at the cost of civil liberties,”<br> Radtke added.  <br> **War Worsens Natural Disasters<br>** The World Risk Index only covers natural disasters, not the dangers of<br> human-caused disasters such as war and conflict.  <br> “But we are increasingly noticing connections,” said<br> Radtke, explaining they had observed an increasing number<br> of natural disasters, in part due to [climate<br> change](https://www.dw.com/en/climate-change/t-18614374), striking conflict zones and having a more detrimental impact. In<br> such events, the World Risk Report speaks of multiple crises.  <br> Studies show, for example, that armed groups grow larger<br> following natural disasters, suggesting that they recruit people who have<br> become suddenly impoverished or displaced. Also, struggles over scarce<br> resources like water, food, energy or relief supplies may intensify, in<br> some cases making conflicts worse.  <br> “But it’s also possible for extreme natural events to<br> create windows of opportunity for conflict parties to come to an agreement,”<br> Radtke pointed out — for example, when all parties involved<br> realize they have to cooperate in order to receive emergency relief<br> and manage reconstruction. This is how the decadeslong insurgency in the<br> Indonesian province of Aceh came to an end following the devastating<br> 2004 tsunami.  <br> **Faith, Solidarity Can Ease Hardship<br>** When countries seek to lower their vulnerability to natural disasters,<br> it’s not enough to beef up classical disaster prevention measures, such as<br> dams, warnings systems and rescue services. “Investing in education and<br> health, and decreasing social inequality can have a large impact on<br> reducing vulnerability,” said Radtke.  <br> She added that reducing corruption also helped<br> shield a population against the effects of natural disasters and pointed<br> out that, luckily, there was a wide range of measures governments could take.<br> But not all could be quantified and depicted in an index, she cautioned. In<br> the Philippines, for example, faith and mutual support among family and<br> community members plays a large role in recovering from natural<br> disasters, she said.  <br> Radtke highlighted that humanity could also take measures<br> to reduce our exposure to natural disaster — that is, the likelihood of one<br> taking place. “That’s because our exposure, at least to certain natural<br> disasters, is directly linked to climate change,” she said.a |
