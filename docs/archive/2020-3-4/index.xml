      <description>&lt;h6&gt;4 March 2020&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;h6&gt;Summary&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local health officials announced new guidance to King County residents aimed at reducing their risk of exposure to COVID-19. While all residents can take steps now, people with underlying health conditions are urged to follow recommendations to avoid large gatherings of people.&lt;h6&gt;Story&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local health officials announced today new recommendations to King County residents aimed at reducing their risk of exposure to COVID-19. We understand these actions will have a tremendous impact on the lives of people in our community. We are making these recommendations in consultation with CDC based on the best information we have currently to protect the public&#39;s health.&lt;p&gt;This is a critical moment in the growing outbreak of COVID-19 in King County and these measures can potentially impact the spread of the disease.&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Health is recommending, but not requiring, the following steps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible, including public places with lots of people and large gatherings where there will be close contact with others. People at higher risk include:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People 60 and older&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People with underlying health conditions including heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People who have weakened immune systems&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People who are pregnant&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Workplaces should enact measures that allow people who can work from home to do so. Taking these measures can help reduce the number of workers who come into contact with COVID-19 and help minimize absenteeism due to illness&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you can feasibly avoid bringing large groups of people together, consider postponing events and gatherings.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Public Health is not recommending closing schools at this time unless there has been a confirmed case in the school. Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County also respects an individual school&#39;s decisions about closures or postponement of activities as each school knows the needs of their community best.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All people should not go out when they are sick.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Avoid visiting hospitals, long term care facilities, or nursing homes to the extent possible. If you need to go, limit your time there and keep six feet away from patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More detail on these measures will be available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kingcounty.gov/covid&#34;&gt;www.kingcounty.gov/covid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 test results have come back from the Washington State Public Health Laboratory confirming ten additional cases of COVID-19 in King County residents including one death.
