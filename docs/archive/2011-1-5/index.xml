That’s according to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://healthyamericans.org/assets/files/TFAH2010ReadyorNot%20FINAL.pdf&#34;&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; supported by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;In fact, the report says “there’s an emergency for emergency health preparedness in the United States.” It calls attention to significant local, state and federal budget cuts and the impact they have had on public health departments’ ability to maintain staff capabilities, and their ability to respond to crises. &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;Key findings include: &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;* 21 states were not able to rapidly identify disease-causing E.coli O157:H7 and submit the lab results in 90 percent of cases within four days during 2007-2008. &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;* 33 states and D.C. cut funding for public health from Fiscal Year 2008-2009 to FY 2009-2010. &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;* Seven states can not currently share data electronically with health care providers. &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;* 10 states do not have an electronic syndrome surveillance system that can report and exchange information. &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;* Six states reported that pre-identified staff were not able to acknowledge notification of emergency exercises or incidents within the target time of 60 minutes at least twice during 2007-2008. &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;* Six states did not activate their emergency operations center a minimum of two times in 2007-2008. &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;* Two states did not develop at least two After-Action Report/Improvement Plans (AAR/IPs) after exercises or real incidents in 2007-2008. &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://healthyamericans.org/assets/files/TFAH2010ReadyorNot%20FINAL.pdf&#34;&gt;View the complete report.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;Source: Dairy Herd Management, Meatingplace&lt;/p&gt;</description>
