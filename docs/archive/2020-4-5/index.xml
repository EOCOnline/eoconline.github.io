      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vashon Island residents will have access to COVID-19 testing for residents whose medical care provider – on or off island - has referred them for a test. Testing will start April 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. operating on weekdays as the availability of testing materials allows.&lt;p&gt;The Vashon Covid-19 Testing Project will use a simplified procedure that minimizes exposure of patients and volunteer staff and the need for precious personal protective equipment. Vashon Island is particularly at risk because clinics and first responders have limited capacity, the island lacks an urgent care clinic or emergency room, and there are many high-risk residents. &lt;p&gt;Testing focuses public health efforts on isolating and supporting infected individuals so they do not infect others. &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Testing helps us identify who has the virus. Once we know who has the virus, we can contact others who have been exposed and test any of those with symptoms. The providers who make the referral are a critical part of this tracking. This is the fastest and most efficient way to stop the spread of COVID-19.”&lt;br&gt;- Dr. Jim Bristow, retired pediatric cardiologist and former deputy director of the Joint Genome Institute at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab&lt;/p&gt;</description>
