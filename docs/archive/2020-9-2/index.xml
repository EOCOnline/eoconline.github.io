First, there was the need to fight the disease, help people understand how to keep themselves and their families safe. Second, our community was being hit by a devastating economic and emotional disaster.&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Islanders at Emotional Risk:&lt;/em&gt; At peak, a quarter of all Vashon workers had applied for unemployment benefits. A Chamber of Commerce survey showed that 40% of our businesses went dark. Schools sent kids home. Hundreds of families are worrying about getting enough food, keeping a home, and making choices between safety and essential work paychecks. Isolated seniors are descending into loneliness and depression. Island social service agencies are seeing increased substance abuse and household violence.&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;573&#34; height=&#34;106&#34; src=&#34;https://vashonbeprepared.org/Portals/1/Graphics/Logos/VashonBePrepared.433x80trans.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
