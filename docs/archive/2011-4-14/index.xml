With massive needs, emergency managers must assign their limited resources to the locations where they can do the most good for the most people. The government will clearly strive to save the most lives: to cities, to large buildings and schools where there are large numbers of people – not to rural homes. Having been at most major disasters in recent decades, he was blunt that the government does not have the resources to quickly rescue small localities like Vashon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Disasters generate 15 years worth of solid waste in just days</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Disasters can typically generate up to fifteen years worth of a community&#39;s solid waste over a few days, with the potential to overwhelm day-to-day solid waste operations and to lead to years of disruption; FEMA estimates that debris removal accounted for 27 percent of their total disaster response costs for those U.S. disasters between 2002 and 2007; prolonged problems with the management of solid waste can lead to public and environmental health issues;&amp;#160; slow management of solid waste can also impede economic recovery by inhibiting rebuilding activities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
