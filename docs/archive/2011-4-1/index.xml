The stripe in the center of the shake map, colored red, shows where the most intense shaking would occur in a hypothetical 7.1 magnitude earthquake on the Tacoma Fault. Geological evidence indicates a similar earthquake last occurred about 1,100 years ago. More details of the Tacoma Fault Scenario study can be seen at http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2010/3023/.&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;Earthquake scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey use computers to generate “shake maps” like this one.

As it turns out, the Tacoma Fault actually runs directly across the center of Vashon, the community that could be most affected if it ruptures. The latest computer analysis indicates that shaking from the fault could be as severe as the recent earthquakes in Christchurch and Sendai. That makes it doubly or even triply important for all of us to be prepared to sustain ourselves for as long as 10 days at home until help can arrive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
