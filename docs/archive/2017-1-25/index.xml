If community support when problems arise is important to you, CERT will likely be an extraordinarily positive experience.  CERT originated in Los Angeles in 1994 to support the city fire department, and has been enhanced and extended to hundreds of communities by FEMA to help citizens safely help each other in various emergencies.  &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;The rewards are:&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;Increased safety at your home &amp;amp; businessIncreased personal preparedness for windstorms, earthquakes and power outages New life-saving and first aid skillsIncreased self-confidence New friendsParticipation in the Vashon communityStylish green hard-hat and hi-vis vest (for team) &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;Requirements to be on the active team: &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;Vashon resident - full-time or part-time Very basic physical fitnessBasic CERT course (3 parts; see back of this flyer) Several additional Vashon-specific trainings (maps, two-way radios, a search exercise, etc.)Four refresher or enrichment trainings each year Comply with CERT policies and codes of conduct Favorable background check by VIFR Responsibility and accountability &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;Typical activations include &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA; search for missing persons (Vashon has no other local search/rescue group), logistical support to the Fire Dept or Sheriff, information gathering during a disaster, and first aid. &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&#xA;CERT does not fight fires, go into unstable buildings, or neglect our own neighborhood.
