      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a fire and smoke map that updates hourly using a variety of sources, including satellite. &lt;p&gt;It’s centered on Oregon when you first pull it up, but if you scroll up you’ll find Washington. You can see the Sumner Grade Fire in Bonney Lake and the newer fire southeast of Enumclaw. &lt;p&gt;If you zoom out, you can clear see the entire west coast on fire. ☹&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://data.statesmanjournal.com/fires/&#34;&gt;https://data.statesmanjournal.com/fires/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

First, there was the need to fight the disease, help people understand how to keep themselves and their families safe. Second, our community was being hit by a devastating economic and emotional disaster.&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Islanders at Emotional Risk:&lt;/em&gt; At peak, a quarter of all Vashon workers had applied for unemployment benefits. A Chamber of Commerce survey showed that 40% of our businesses went dark. Schools sent kids home. Hundreds of families are worrying about getting enough food, keeping a home, and making choices between safety and essential work paychecks. Isolated seniors are descending into loneliness and depression. Island social service agencies are seeing increased substance abuse and household violence.&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;573&#34; height=&#34;106&#34; src=&#34;https://vashonbeprepared.org/Portals/1/Graphics/Logos/VashonBePrepared.433x80trans.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Vashon Island residents to have COVID-19 Testing Project</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/oconline.github.io/insights/2020/2020-04-05_entry432/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vashon Island residents will have access to COVID-19 testing for residents whose medical care provider – on or off island - has referred them for a test. Testing will start April 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. operating on weekdays as the availability of testing materials allows.&lt;p&gt;The Vashon Covid-19 Testing Project will use a simplified procedure that minimizes exposure of patients and volunteer staff and the need for precious personal protective equipment. Vashon Island is particularly at risk because clinics and first responders have limited capacity, the island lacks an urgent care clinic or emergency room, and there are many high-risk residents. &lt;p&gt;Testing focuses public health efforts on isolating and supporting infected individuals so they do not infect others. &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Testing helps us identify who has the virus. Once we know who has the virus, we can contact others who have been exposed and test any of those with symptoms. The providers who make the referral are a critical part of this tracking. This is the fastest and most efficient way to stop the spread of COVID-19.”&lt;br&gt;- Dr. Jim Bristow, retired pediatric cardiologist and former deputy director of the Joint Genome Institute at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you must go out, avoid using any kind of public transportation, ridesharing, or taxis. &#xA;&lt;li&gt;Monitor your symptoms carefully. If your symptoms get worse, call your healthcare provider immediately. &#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get rest and stay hydrated. &#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you have a medical appointment, call the healthcare provider ahead of time and tell them that you have or may have COVID-19. &#xA;&lt;li&gt;For medical emergencies, call 911 and notify the dispatch personnel that you have or may have COVID-19. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;When to Seek Medical Attention&lt;p&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;If you develop &lt;strong&gt;emergency warning signs&lt;/strong&gt; for COVID-19 get &lt;strong&gt;medical attention immediately&lt;/strong&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recommendations for people at high risk &lt;/b&gt;for complications from COVID-19 (i.e. older than 60 years, have chronic medical conditions or weakened immune systems, or who are pregnant) and families who live with them: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure you have access to&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;several weeks of medications and supplies&lt;/strong&gt;. Create a household plan of action (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcommunity%2Fhome%2Fget-your-household-ready-for-COVID-19.html&amp;amp;data=02%7C01%7CJIC.ECC%40kingcounty.gov%7Cbc698b2a47674a682a5a08d7c45842ad%7Cbae5059a76f049d7999672dfe95d69c7%7C0%7C0%7C637193755676471458&amp;amp;sdata=3BmYNHRWOSxdhaIGcV%2F3IcGv8puoHSStrEp5NuFzpqY%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0&#34;&gt;CDC’s home plan checklist&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid close contact with people who are sick.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid crowds and other congregate settings. &lt;/strong&gt;Try to avoid being in large groups of people, especially in poorly ventilated spaces.&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean your hands often. &lt;/strong&gt;Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean and disinfect your home to remove germs. &lt;/strong&gt;Practice routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces (for example: tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, sinks) with household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants that are appropriate for the surface, following label instructions.&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention for potential symptoms. &lt;/strong&gt;COVID-19 symptoms can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What to do if you have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 or are worried that you may have COVID-19</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/oconline.github.io/insights/2020/2020-03-06_entry423/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;March 5, 2020&lt;h6&gt;Summary&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Health has specific advice for people who have been confirmed with COVID-19, have been around someone with COVID-19, or are feeling unwell but haven’t been in close contact with someone with COVID-19. With respect to testing, Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County does not typically conduct testing. Testing is typically conducted by taking a swab at a health care provider’s office.&lt;h6&gt;Story&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;In King County, we currently have reported 51 confirmed cases of COVID-19. We are likely to see many more cases of COVID-19 in the coming days and weeks. Symptoms of COVID-19 typically include fever, cough or shortness of breath. Here is guidance on what to do:&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do if you have confirmed or suspected COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Restrict activities outside your home, except for getting medical care.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Separate yourself from other people and animals in your home.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do not go to work, school or public areas.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Avoid using public transportation, taxis, or ride-share.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Monitor your symptoms and call before visiting your doctor. If you have an appointment, be sure you tell them you have or may have COVID-19.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you have one, wear a facemask around other people, such as sharing a room or vehicle, or around pets and before entering a healthcare provider&#39;s office.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you can&#39;t wear a mask because it&#39;s hard for you to breathe while wearing one, then keep people who live with you out of your room, or have them wear a facemask if they come in your room.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throw away in a lined trashcan. Wash hands thoroughly afterwards. Soap and water is best.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Avoid sharing personal household items like dishes and glasses, or bedding.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. If you can&#39;t wash your hands, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Rub hands together until dry.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Clean all &#34;high touch&#34; surfaces every day, such as counters, tables, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, phones, and keyboards.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use a household cleaning product to clean, following the manufacturer&#39;s recommendations.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1. Notify dispatch that you have or may have COVID-19&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Remain in home isolation for 7 days OR until 72 hours after your fever has resolved (and symptoms get better) whichever is longer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do if you were potentially exposed to someone with confirmed COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, know that you generally need to be in close contact with someone with COVID-19 to get infected. Close contact includes scenarios like living with or caring for a person with confirmed COVID-19, being within six feet of a person with confirmed COVID-19 for about 10 minutes, or if someone with COVID-19 coughed on you, kissed you, shared utensils with you or you had direct contact with their body secretions.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you may have had close contact with a person with COVID-19 &lt;u&gt;but are not sick&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor your health for fever, cough and shortness of breath for 14 days after your last contact with the ill person.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do not go to school or work. Avoid public places for 14 days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are a close contact of a person with confirmed COVID-19 &lt;u&gt;and are sick&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are sick with fever, cough, or shortness of breath, even if your symptoms are mild, isolate yourself.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you are at higher risk for severe illness (over 60, with underlying health conditions such as heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes), have a weakened immune system or are pregnant) call your health care provider. They may want to test you for COVID-19.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you have symptoms but are not in a high risk category, talk with your health care provider. They will help you determine if you need to be evaluated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do if you have COVID-19 symptoms but haven&#39;t been around anyone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. These can be symptoms of other respiratory illnesses as well as COVID-19.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you are in a high-risk category, and have symptoms of COVID-19, call your healthcare provider for advice. If you are at risk for serious illness, your healthcare provider may arrange a test for COVID-19.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you do not have a high risk condition and your symptoms are mild, you do not need to be tested for COVID-19. Do not go out when you are sick, practice excellent hygiene, and wear a facemask when you are around other people if you can.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Cover coughs and sneezes. Avoid sharing personal household items. Clean your hands often. Clean all &#34;high-touch&#34; surfaces like doorknobs often.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Monitor your symptoms and call your health care provider if symptoms worsen.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stay home and avoid others for 72 hours after your fever goes down and symptoms get better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more detailed information or to print these recommendations and share them with others click on the following links:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/COVIDcasepositive.pdf&#34;&gt;What to do if you have confirmed or suspected COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/COVIDexposed.pdf&#34;&gt;What to do if you were potentially exposed to someone with confirmed COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/COVIDconcerned.pdf&#34;&gt;What to do if you have symptoms of COVID-19 and have not been around anyone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the capacity for testing in Washington state is inadequate for the number of people who want to be tested. Therefore, only people at highest risk for serious illness are likely to be tested currently. That should change as soon as soon as tomorrow as the public health system and private laboratories increase testing capacity.&lt;p&gt;Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County does not typically conduct testing. Testing is typically conducted by taking a swab at a health care provider&#39;s office.&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All King County residents should follow this advice:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not go to the emergency room unless essential.&lt;/strong&gt; Emergency rooms need to be able to serve those with the most critical needs. If you have symptoms like cough, fever, or other respiratory problems, contact your regular doctor first.&lt;li&gt;Stay home when sick.&lt;li&gt;Practice excellent personal hygiene habits, including handwashing, coughing into tissue or elbow, avoid touching eyes, nose, or mouth.&lt;li&gt;Stay away from people who are ill, especially if you are 60 and older or have underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, or a weakened immune system, or if you are pregnant.&lt;li&gt;Stay informed. Information is changing frequently. Check and subscribe to Public Health&#39;s website (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/health/communicable-diseases/disease-control/novel-coronavirus.aspx&#34;&gt;www.kingcounty.gov/COVID&lt;/a&gt;) or blog (&lt;a href=&#34;https://publichealthinsider.com/category/novel-coronavirus/&#34;&gt;www.publichealthinsider.com&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;Remember to take every day preventive action such as washing hands, and if you are sick stay home. During an outbreak with a new virus there is a lot of uncertainty. Our guidance and advice is subject to change as we learn more. We will continue to keep you updated.</description>

      <title>Local health officials announce new recommendations to reduce risk of spread of COVID-19</title>

      <description>&lt;h6&gt;4 March 2020&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;h6&gt;Summary&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local health officials announced new guidance to King County residents aimed at reducing their risk of exposure to COVID-19. While all residents can take steps now, people with underlying health conditions are urged to follow recommendations to avoid large gatherings of people.&lt;h6&gt;Story&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local health officials announced today new recommendations to King County residents aimed at reducing their risk of exposure to COVID-19. We understand these actions will have a tremendous impact on the lives of people in our community. We are making these recommendations in consultation with CDC based on the best information we have currently to protect the public&#39;s health.&lt;p&gt;This is a critical moment in the growing outbreak of COVID-19 in King County and these measures can potentially impact the spread of the disease.&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Health is recommending, but not requiring, the following steps:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible, including public places with lots of people and large gatherings where there will be close contact with others. People at higher risk include:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People 60 and older&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People with underlying health conditions including heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People who have weakened immune systems&#xA;&lt;li&gt;People who are pregnant&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Workplaces should enact measures that allow people who can work from home to do so. Taking these measures can help reduce the number of workers who come into contact with COVID-19 and help minimize absenteeism due to illness&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you can feasibly avoid bringing large groups of people together, consider postponing events and gatherings.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Public Health is not recommending closing schools at this time unless there has been a confirmed case in the school. Public Health – Seattle &amp;amp; King County also respects an individual school&#39;s decisions about closures or postponement of activities as each school knows the needs of their community best.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All people should not go out when they are sick.&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Avoid visiting hospitals, long term care facilities, or nursing homes to the extent possible. If you need to go, limit your time there and keep six feet away from patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;More detail on these measures will be available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kingcounty.gov/covid&#34;&gt;www.kingcounty.gov/covid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 test results have come back from the Washington State Public Health Laboratory confirming ten additional cases of COVID-19 in King County residents including one death.
