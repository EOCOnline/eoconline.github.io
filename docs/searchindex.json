We provide a sample spreadsheet already filled out, but you should edit the positions to reflect your EOC organization chart. (Maybe start with only a few key/top positions for the initial phase.)\nBe aware of setting too high a bar for staff and volunteers, so a total number of skills/tasks required per position is shown across the botton as a reality check.

  "content":"Study by DNR geophysicist suggests hazardous Seattle Fault Zone developed as the edge of the continent split more than 50 million years ago \u0026nbsp;\nThe Seattle fault zone is a network of shallow faults slicing through the lowlands of Puget Sound, threatening to create damaging earthquakes for the more than four million people who live there. A new origin story, proposed by Washington State Department of Natural Resources geophysicist Megan Anderson and others in a new study, could explain the fault system\u0026rsquo;s earliest history and help scientists improve hazard modeling for the densely populated region.\nThe study was published in Tectonics, AGU\u0026rsquo;s journal for research exploring the evolution, structure and change of Earth\u0026rsquo;s crust and upper mantle. It suggests that an island chain was pulled towards the larger continent about 55 million years ago, ran into the North American plate and split into two, with part of the chain going over the top of the crust layer, and the rest getting sucked underneath it. Study authors posit that this split set the stage for the modern Seattle fault.\n\u0026ldquo;This fascinating study from one of our geophysicists at the Department of Natural Resources could shape understanding of this region for the next generation,\u0026rdquo; said Commissioner of Public Lands, Hilary Franz.\n\u0026ldquo;It was a total surprise,\u0026rdquo; said Anderson, lead author on the study and a geophysicist with the Washington Geological Survey, a division of DNR. \u0026ldquo;It wasn\u0026rsquo;t something we were going for originally, but our results predict a major ancient fault where the Seattle fault is today.\u0026rdquo;\nA massive mystery\nThe Pacific Northwest lies just inland from the Cascadia subduction zone, where dense oceanic crust gets pulled under the continent. In 1700, a roughly 1000-kilometer (620-mile) rupture of the subduction zone created a massive quake between magnitude 8.7 and 9.2. Smaller quakes shook the region throughout the 1900s \u0026ndash; most recently during the 2001 Nisqually earthquake. The Seattle fault ruptured in 923-924 AD, based on local Indigenous oral traditions and geologic evidence along the Puget Sound shoreline.\nDespite the region\u0026rsquo;s seismic activity, scientists didn\u0026rsquo;t begin to study the Seattle fault zone in earnest until the 1990s.\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s a lot more uncertainty about the Seattle fault than, for example, the San Andreas fault,\u0026rdquo; Anderson said. \u0026ldquo;The Seattle fault could generate something like a magnitude 7.2 earthquake, and we want to be prepared for it. There\u0026rsquo;s still a lot to learn so that engineering geologists can do better simulations for earthquakes and understand the potential risks to our communities.\u0026rdquo;\nPrevious work to determine the geometry of the Seattle fault at depth relied primarily on seismic data, which are sound waves traveling through and being reflected by underground layers of rock. The data revealed faults and geologic structures that seismologists and geologists interpreted differently. They knew the region hosted a major fault zone, but scientists had proposed different ways parts of the fault are connected, how deep it extends, and how steeply it cuts through the bedrock.\nMagnetic data revealed a key secret seismic data point previously missed: deep in the crust, the bedrock consistently alternates between being more and less magnetic, suggesting slanted layers of changing rock type. In a map-based view, features on either side of the Seattle faut zone angle away from each other \u0026ndash; north of the Seattle fault zone, structures are angled north-northwest, while in the south, they\u0026rsquo;re oriented north-northeast.\u0026nbsp;\nThose wonky orientations gave Anderson pause; they hinted at an ancient mountain range. To connect the map view with known, deeper bedrock geology, Anderson modeled a vertical profile of rocks underground and found some of those structures dip at different orientations underground, too.\n\u0026ldquo;These are all very different orientations,\u0026rdquo; Anderson said. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s very hard to do that unless there\u0026rsquo;s a place where the structures get disconnected from each other and then restart.\u0026rdquo;\nA tear in the crustal continuum\nThe data suggested that about 55 million years ago, as the subduction zone pulled in a string of oceanic islands, the northern half of the island chain was subducted, but the southern half was added to the top of the crust, or obducted.\nAs the islands were obducted over millions of years, they crumpled into a fold-and-thrust mountain belt with topography like the Blue Ridge Mountains of Appalachia. The zone where the islands switched from being subducted to being accreted would have been under incredible strain and been ripped apart.\n\u0026ldquo;It would have been this slow, ongoing tear, almost like the crust unzipping itself,\u0026rdquo; Anderson said. \u0026ldquo;As this progressed, the tear fault got longer and longer.\u0026rdquo;\nThe \u0026ldquo;torn\u0026rdquo; region overlaps perfectly with the modern Seattle fault zone. The intense tearing stopped after the islands were crunched into the continent, but the zone of intense tearing created fragmented, weakened crust, setting the geologic stage for the modern Seattle fault zone.\nBeyond offering a possible explanation for why the fault zone exists, the study\u0026rsquo;s results about the geometry of Washington\u0026rsquo;s more ancient faults and geologic structures provide valuable details about the bedrock under and within the Seattle basin. This basin is filled with kilometers of looser sedimentary rock which make seismic ground shaking stronger, and the new data can help scientists make more accurate models of future ground shaking in the area.\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026quot;This buried tectonic story was so much fun to discover, and now it will provide a great basis for getting back to answering our original questions about active fault geometry for the Seattle fault and other faults in western Washington,\u0026rdquo; Anderson said.\n----\nThis study is published in Tectonics, with free access provided for 30 days after publication.

  "content":"Effective Thursday June 1st at 0800hrs the King County Fire Chief\u0026rsquo;s Association, King County Fire Marshals Association and the King County Fire Marshal are implementing a STAGE 1 (burn restrictions) Ban.\u0026nbsp; This ban specifically relates to yard debris/residential burning.\nIn response to the increased Fuel Energy Release Rates (ERC), decreased 100-hour fuel moisture content (F100), and anticipated warmer weather conditions the King County Fire Chiefs and the King County Fire Marshals, collectively are implementing a STAGE 1 Burn Ban (burn restrictions).\u0026nbsp; Recreational Fires, Gas/propane appliances, including grills, pellet smokers and charcoal grills are still permitted.\nThe King County Fire Chiefs, Fire Marshals and local jurisdictions encourage all residents to burn according to their local jurisdictions requirements and maintain a fire safe environment.\u0026nbsp; If you have any questions, please contact your local Fire Department.\nApproved Recreational Burn Requirements: *note some jurisdictions require burning permit\nFirewood shall be seasoned and dry. Be built in a metal or concrete fire pit, such as those typically found in designated campgrounds; and not be used as debris disposal. Grow no larger than three feet in diameter. Be in a clear spot free from any vegetation for at least 10 feet in a horizontal direction, including at least 25 feet away from any structure and allow 20-foot vertical clearance from overhanging branches. Recreational fires shall be always attended by an alert individual and equipment capable of extinguishing the fire with a shovel and a 5-gallon bucket of water or with a connected and charged water hose. Completely extinguish campfires by pouring water or moist soil in them and stirring with a shovel until all parts are cool to the touch. The use of self-contained camp stoves is encouraged as an alternative. No burning when winds exceed 15 MPH. For additional information or questions please see www.VIFR.org or contact administration@vifr.org.\u0026nbsp;\n"},{

  "content":"Now that the National Weather Service Excessive Heat Warning has been extended through Saturday, the heat safety tips are even more important. The following tips have been compiled from multiple sources by the Vashon Emergency Operations Center and VashonBePrepared, in collaboration with Vashon Island Fire \u0026amp; Rescue.Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water before you feel thirsty.Ideally, stay indoors and out of the heat of the day, generally from midday to early evening.If your job requires you to work outside, do what you can to work in the shade and be especially mindful of getting plenty of water, taking breaks in the shade or in a cool space, and avoiding sunburn. Try to perform critical outdoor tasks in the morning only.You can keep your home cooler by shutting blinds, drawing curtains, and keeping windows closed while outdoor temperatures are higher than indoor temperatures. Of course, use fans or air-conditioners, if you have them. Once outdoor temperatures drop below indoor temperatures, open your windows and cross-ventilate to cool down your house.Be neighborly. Check on your neighbors, friends, and family in the area – particularly seniors and people with medical conditions – to ensure they are not suffering from heat illness at home.Signs of heat exhaustion are heavy sweating; weakness; cold, pale, and clammy skin; weak pulse; fainting; vomiting.Signs of heat stroke are high body temperature (103F or higher); hot, dry skin; rapid and strong pulse; possible unconsciousness. Heat stroke is a medical emergency - call 911 and take measures to cool the person down.Never leave children or pets in a vehicle. During extreme heat, temperatures inside cars can skyrocket in minutes to deadly levels.If you are taking your dog for walks, don't overexert them or yourself. Make sure you and your pet are taking in plenty of water.If you are headed to the beach or pool, keep a close eye on kids to prevent drowning. Drowning is fast. Silent. Preventable.Know how to spot the signs of a person drowning. They:Usually cannot call for helpUsually cannot wave their armsMay be vertical in the waterMay look like they are climbing a ladderTheir mouth may bob above and below the water "},{

There will be relief overnight as temperatures fall into the low sixties.The National Weather Service classifies this as a level three heat risk event out of a possible four levels in the National Weather Service classification system. Level three means the heat is a high risk for much of the population, especially those who are heat-sensitive and those without effective cooling or adequate hydration.VashonBePrepared and the Vashon Emergency Operations Center, in collaboration with Vashon Island Fire \u0026amp; Rescue, have worked with community partners to open two cooling centers on Vashon and they will continue in operation with some changes in opening hours.Vashon Public Library will be open today from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm.

  "content":"Content Ideas for an EOC website Have you considered these topics for inclusion into your Emergency Operations Center\u0026rsquo;s website? Hopefully these can inspire some discussions about how to build your own website - for the public, your partners, and your staff and volunteers!\nThis is quite an exhaustive listing of topics and pages that may or may not reflect your community needs and messaging goals. Consider the ongoing upkeep effort - and readership\u0026rsquo;s enthusiasm - before planning a vast site that may duplicate others in your region. Many topics might just require a sentence/paragraph to cover - not a page! Much of this may be covered by ongoing training and other standard departmental HR sessions, but it is worth having some resource section that spells all these details out, whether on this website or another.\nThe main categories are broken up by possible audiences. These different segments may be on different websites or \u0026ndash; by requiring logins to view (or even edit) non-public content \u0026ndash; all on one unified website. Your environment will dictate your options.\nIf you have website technology that allows logging in a assigning roles easily, you can control who can see, or even edit, various pages or sections of your website. That requires creating \u0026amp; managing usernames and logins, requiring time \u0026amp; effort.\nSelf-Assess, Before Plowing In For new and smaller EOC\u0026rsquo;s it is recommended to avoid recreating all the following content if it only mirrors that of your local county or state website.\nAs an alternative approach, it can be very effective to have a few pages pertaining to local organizations, contacts, and planning efforts, but to let another organization (with sufficient budget and staffing) handle the primary and ongoing messaging.\nHaving a unified message is most critical to reassure citizens and organizations. If you do not anticipate having public relations staffing during serious events then consider coordinating with your parent organizations for handling your messaging too. Certainly clarify ahead of time your various roles in different scenarios!\nPublic Pages Home Page\nWelcome message identifying intended audience and website purpose Brief introduction with your purpose and authority Navigation to the rest of the site Latest news and rotating content Links to other websites for official emergency news and content (National Weather Service, InciWeb, State Emergency Division, etc.) Login for website authoring Temporal Information (i.e., blog) Blogs are a great way to get out current emergency information. People understand them and form a habit of reviewing them, often subscribe for updates, and can easily search for older news postsin a chronological fashion.\n(We do NOT recommend having a different site or page dedicated to emergency information. It confuses readers when they can least handle it, and creates problems as incidents cycle through various phases and during multiple overlapping emergencies.)\n\u0026ldquo;Timeless\u0026rdquo; information that only changes slowly over time, and is generally applicable.\nWhy Prepare, i.e., Hazards Ideally this matches and reflects your community THIRA, optionally with specific pages one your key risks, presenting current science and mitigation measures that can be taken. How to Prepare Local Residents Homeowners Go Kits Renters Go Kits Homeless Visitors, if you are a popular tourist destination Businesses Continuity Planning Community Business Groups Historical timeline or background Staff Contacts Organization Chart Staff Roles and contact information Current programs and planning efforts Partners How to Donate Whether seeking money or material \u0026ndash; or more likely discouraging clothing, bedding and other cumbersome, donations that might force a complete warehouse setup(!), you can lay out your guidelines How to Volunteer What are the organizations, roles and credentialing expected of volunteers Volunteer Pages Welcome Intro to your role in the EOC Chain of COmmand Job Description Job Aides Standard Procedures Scheduling Training \u0026amp; Certification Financial EOC Resources available Expectations/scope/limits/DEI resources Partners ARES/ACS CERT Citizen Corps Council Firewise Neighborhood Watch Partner Agency Pages Welcome Intro to your role in the EOC Standard Procedures EOC Resources available Expectations/scope/limits/DEI resources Partners Local County State Federal Internal Staff Pages Sign-in (who has access, to all or part of the site?)\nCurrent Incidents\nIncident (select current and old incidents of interest)\nFor Each Incident IAP Objectives Strategies Staffing Situation Awareness Missions EOC (This will vary based on your EOC Model: ICS/ISM/Departmental)\nCOmmand Staff Operations Section Planning Section Logistics Section Administrative \u0026amp; Finance Section Contact Info\nEOC Sections Units Volunteers CERT ACS MRC Partners Vendors Regional Partners State or County Agencies/Departments Wiki Alerting User Guides Std Op Procedures Planning Welcome to new staff and volunteers\nDEI EOC training expectations and opportunities Financial policies and reimbursement forms Standard Operating Proceedures Guide to EOC Resources electronic facilities manuals audio/visual equipment other documentation Reference\nTraining Calender Contacts ICS Forms Wiki Document Library Passwords Other topics Reliability: Cloud vs On-prem Multiple incidents Access from field: onsite vs remote incident admin Security \u0026amp; access control IAP build Moving pages No \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; alert page to replace the home page?

You likely need do this periodically between the following steps.\nnpm run update1 (i.e., npx ng update @angular/core @angular/cli --next) npm run update2 (i.e., npx ng update --next) Update any packages as listed by the above command, e.g., ng update @angular/cli @angular/core @angular/google-maps --next npm run update3 (i.e., npx npm-check-updates --next) npm run update4 (i.e., npx npm-check-updates -u) which updates package.json to the latest format - only if requested by the previous command npm run update5 (i.e., npm install) npm run update6 (i.e., npm i -g rimraf Post-Update Checkup) Running unit tests Run ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nFurther help To get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.\nPublic Feedback \u0026amp; Contribution We encourage your feedback and contributions to this repository.

  "content":"FEMA released the 10th annual 2021 National Preparedness Report (NPR). This year's report presents preparedness data through the lens of risks and capabilities and underscores the challenges that emergency managers face in addressing a continuously expanding risk environment, the ingenuity they have shown to rise to those challenges, and opportunities that remain to better prepare the nation. Emergency managers and whole community partners across the nation can look to this year's report to help support decisions about program priorities, resource allocations, and community actions.\nWhat does the report say about the state of the nation's preparedness? The report summarizes the state of national preparedness, discussing the risks the nation faces and how those risks drive whole-community emergency management capability requirements. The report includes the following findings and discussion topics: Climate change continues to impact the nation and worsen existing vulnerabilities, many of which were revealed by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, ongoing racial, social, and financial inequalities may limit response and recovery during and after disasters.Vulnerabilities remain within supply chains and aging infrastructure. The risks posed by misinformation and cyber threats continue to increase in scale and impact faster than the nation is able to build the capabilities needed to manage them.Overall, the nation is closer to achieving its preparedness goals identified through the National Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment; however, affected communities may not be fully prepared to respond to nationally catastrophic incidents.The COVID-19 pandemic shows that many gaps remain in the nation's preparedness; however, this provides an opportunity to identify strengths and shortfalls in capabilities, and apply lessons learned in a strategic way.For the first time ever, the report provides management opportunities outlining steps that community leaders can take to address capability gaps. These include a justification for a preparedness investment strategy to help close capability gaps and improve capabilities, an explanation of what all levels of government are doing or can do to manage climate change, and how climate change worsens existing vulnerabilities.It also includes a discussion of the National Preparedness System and the importance of maintaining the connections between the components of this system, including the Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment and Stakeholder Preparedness Review, threat and hazard modeling, and planning.\n"},{

  "content":"SEATTLE — Together, FEMA and Bonneville Seattle have completed an important modernization at the emergency radio broadcast facility at Bonneville International’s KIRO-AM 710 in Seattle. This modernization project improves emergency alert systems that provide critical alerts and warnings to the public.The KIRO-AM facility serves as a Primary Entry Point (PEP) station for FEMA’s National Public Warning System (NPWS), maintained under FEMA’s Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS), and provides critical information to the public before, during and after incidents and disasters.Under the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization Act enacted in 2015, Congress required FEMA to upgrade PEP stations across the country to ensure continuity of terrestrial broadcast services under all hazards. PEP stations are specially designated NPWS broadcast stations that serve as the primary intake source of initial broadcasts for a national alert. FEMA equips these stations, which are operated by local station personnel, with backup communications equipment and power generators that enable them to continue broadcasting information to the public during and after an emergency, including conveying official alerts to communities regionally and nationwide. These free-standing emergency studios, located at the radio transmitter sites, are specially designed and hardened to withstand various natural disasters and acts of terrorism. This helps ensure that the President can alert and warn the public under all conditions. Currently, there are 77 PEP stations that are capable of reaching 90 percent of the U.S. population.KIRO-AM is the 14th PEP station to complete the all-hazards upgrade. The modernization to the emergency studio includes increased sheltering capabilities, expanded broadcast capacity, and sustainable power generation for all types of hazardous events, increasing KIRO-AM’s resiliency to continue broadcasting during emergencies.“It’s an honor for Bonneville Seattle to serve the community and we are proud to partner with FEMA. We share and salute the agency’s commitment to protecting the public,” said Darrell Brown, President, Bonneville International. “Radio is a lifeline, and the new studio and continued investment will ensure KIRO-AM 710’s resiliency during times of crisis when communication is vital.”\"For generations, the KIRO-AM signal has been designated by the federal government as the one to broadcast critical information in case of a major disaster,\" said Cathy Cangiano, Senior VP/Market Manager, Bonneville Seattle. \"It's a responsibility we take seriously. We are committed to getting out lifesaving information when our region needs us.\"If required, and in a national worst-case scenario, KIRO-AM would broadcast a message from the President or other national authorities within 10 minutes. Via FEMA’s Emergency Alert System, other radio stations in the Seattle area would begin re-broadcasting the information coming from KIRO and its news staff. Local authorities, such as the King County Office of Emergency Management, may also disseminate life-saving information by way of the new facilities installed at the KIRO tower site.FEMA, KIRO and King County are partners in distributing life-saving emergency information to the public.FEMA and Bonneville Seattle will hold an event on Friday, November 19, 2021, (11 a.m. to 1 p.m. PT) to unveil the upgraded KIRO-AM transmitter and PEP Site (22805 Dockton Road SW, Vashon, WA 98070.) The news conference will include FEMA and local officials, as well as a live demonstration from KIRO-AM 710 on-air hosts.Speakers include:Antwane Johnson, Director, Integrated Public Alert and Warning System, FEMA Manny Centeno, IPAWS Program Manager, FEMA Brendan McCluskey, Director, King County Office of Emergency Management Jason Shirron, Technical Operations Coordinator, King County OEM Vince Maykovich, Acting Regional Administrator, FEMA Region 10 Cathy Cangiano, VP/Market Manager, Bonneville Seattle Jason Ornellas, Regional Director of Engineering, Bonneville International West Region Dave Ross, On-Air Host, KIRO Radio 97.3 FM For more information about IPAWS or the PEP modernization effort, go to FEMA’s website at https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning- system/broadcasters-wireless.

Outdoor cooking and heating appliances are restricted to approved manufactured gas and charcoal units only.\nThe Stage 2 burn ban goes into effect immediately for King County, which was already in a Stage 1 burn ban. King County’s ban is in coordination with the King County Fire Chiefs Association and Fire Marshals, which extends the ban into cities.During a Stage 2 burn ban, any outdoor fire such as a backyard fire pit or campfire using chopped firewood or charcoal is prohibited. Under the ban, any person with a recreational fire who fails to take immediate action to extinguish or discontinue when ordered or notified to do so can be charged with, up to and including, a misdemeanor.Manufactured portable outdoor devices are allowed, including barbeques and patio warmers that are used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Approved fuel devices - including those that rely on charcoal, natural gas or propane gas – are also allowed. Ricketts asks residents to please use caution when disposing of charcoal remains.Extended periods of abnormally high temperatures have increased the fuel load in the vegetation in our community. The large fire in Oregon and other fires in Washington have stretched wildfire fighting resources throughout the region.Ricketts says if residents must smoke, they should exercise extreme caution with their ashes or when they’re extinguishing cigarettes. The county asks residents to be diligent and respectful of their neighbors, and to remember this is a demanding time for first responders.LINKSKing County Burn Ban \u0026amp; Fireworks "},{

  "content":"Vashon COVID Update: Delta Wave of COVID Has Taken Hold on Vashon -- Vaccination Has Been Working\nThis is a COVID Update from Vashon Medical Reserve Corps and VashonBePrepared.Vashon COVID cases have jumped significantly over the last six weeks. After staying flat at 121 cases through June, Vashon's total pandemic case count has jumped to 138. Cases on Vashon have been increasing at the rate of about one per day. Roughly one-fifth of the cases are in kids, 11 years and younger, who are not yet eligible for vaccination. With the Delta variant being dominant, in this wave, kids are much more likely to display symptoms than before. Fortunately, vaccination has been working and we have not had a massive spike on Vashon like the one experienced in November and December before vaccination was available. Vashon has not had a new hospitalization since January. Vaccinated individuals who become ill generally have mild symptoms as predicted by the vaccine clinical trials and they continue to be protected against death or hospitalization.However, given the surge of Delta cases nationwide, it's important to understand that recent studies show that vaccinated persons can transmit the virus to others. The Delta variant is also more infectious. These findings reflect the much larger amount of virus that people infected with Delta carry in their nose and is also consistent with recent experience that suggests Delta requires a reduced exposure time for infection if you're around someone who is infectious. That's why it is doubly important now to avoid infection, so it doesn't spread and possibly breed new variants. The best defense to avoid getting sick is to get vaccinated.\u0026nbsp; Even though vaccine doesn't prevent all disease, it’s a fact that full vaccination greatly reduces chances of infection and reduces symptoms if you are infected. On Vashon 83% of our 12 and older residents are fully vaccinated and 93% have received at least one dose of vaccine. Nevertheless, about half of the recent cases are fully vaccinated individuals. So many people on Vashon are vaccinated, it increases the odds that relatively rare cases of COVID in the vaccinated would be concentrated on the island.A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study concluded that completing both doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines significantly increases protection against severe disease, from 82% for one dose to 94% for 2 doses.\u0026nbsp; If you’ve received your first dose, but delayed the second, get your second dose without delay. In this uncertain time, you can keep yourself, your family and the Vashon community safe by getting vaccinated to reduce COVID risk.Masks are key tools to prevent spread for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Washington Department of Health and Public Health -- Seattle \u0026amp; King County strongly recommend all persons wear masks in public indoor spaces. This applies to all persons vaccinated and non-vaccinated. Please respect requests of local businesses or organizations for masks or vaccinations to help protect our community.If you have symptoms or believe you were exposed to someone with COVID, call Vashon’s Medical Reserve Corps (MRC), at (844) 469-4554 to get an assessment of your risk and to facilitate testing. For more information on COVID testing and other COVID matters go to: VashonBePrepared.org/COVID/Testing\nActualización de COVID en VashonLa variable Delta, ha tomado control de la islaLas vacunas están funcionadoEste es un mensaje de actualización sobre COVID del Cuerpo de Reservas Médicas y VashonBePrepared.Como escucharon antes, el número de casos de COVID en la isla ha aumentado de una manera muy significativa en las últimas 6 semanas después de no haber tenido ningún caso desde principios de junio, donde teníamos 121 casos y ahora tenemos 138. Los casos en Vashon han ido aumentado a un ritmo de 1 caso por día. Aproximadamente 1/5 de los casos o 20% han sido en chicos de 11 años para abajo, que actualmente no califican para vacunarse, indicando que los de 12 para arriba que no se han vacunado, están a alto riesgo de contagiarse. Con la variante Delta tan predominante en esta ola, es más probable que los niños presenten síntomas en comparación con la infección por las otras variantes. Afortunadamente la vacuna ha funcionado muy bien y no hemos tenido un número tan alto de casos como en noviembre y diciembre del año pasado, antes de que nos llegara la vacuna. No hemos tenido ninguna hospitalización desde enero y los individuos ya vacunados que se han infectado o enfermado, han presentado cuadros muy leves como lo habían predicho los estudios de seguimiento después de la vacuna, porque la vacuna nos protege de una enfermedad seria y de estar hospitalizados.\u0026nbsp; Pero, dada la alta prevalencia de la variante Delta en todo el país, es importante entender que los estudios más recientes muestran que las personas vacunadas que se infectan pueden transmitir el virus a otras personas.Como les he mencionado anteriormente, la variante Delta es más infecciosa. Estos hallazgos reflejan que las personas infectadas tienen una mayor concentración del virus en sus vías respiratorias, y esto es consistente con la idea de que el tiempo de exposición que se necesita alrededor de una persona infectada, es mucho menor. Esta es la razón por la que hay que evitar a toda costa el infectarnos, para no propagar la infección y posiblemente generar nuevos cambios en el virus. Recuerden que mientras más se alarga el tener tantos casos, más oportunidades le damos al virus para que cambie de nuevo. La mejor defensa para evitar la enfermedad es VACUNARSE. Porque, aunque la vacuna en muchos casos no previene un cuadro leve, si reduce enormemente la posibilidad de un cuadro serio. En Vashon el 83% de los residentes de 12 años para arriba están completamente vacunados y el 93% ha recibido por lo menos una dosis.\u0026nbsp; Sin embargo, la mitad de los casos que hemos tenido en los últimos días, han sido en gente ya vacunada y esto es porque un muy alto porcentaje de la población está ya vacunada. Un estudio del CDC concluyó que el ponerse las dos dosis de las vacunas de Pfizer y Moderna aumenta la protección contra un cuadro infeccioso grave, del 82% al 94%, un aumento muy significativo. Si usted ya recibió su primera dosis, pero por alguna razón no se ha puesto la segunda, por favor hágalo cuanto antes. En estos tiempos tan inciertos, la mejor forma de protegerse usted, a su familia, amigos y a la comunidad, es vacunándose.A estas alturas no queda la menor duda de que el uso de cubrebocas es la mejor herramienta para prevenir la dispersión del virus en vacunados y no vacunados. El Departamento de Salud y Salud Pública – de Seattle y el condado King, recomiendan encarecidamente que todas las personas usen cubrebocas en lugares interiores, vacunados y no vacunados. También les pedimos que por favor respeten las reglas que cada uno de los negocios y organizaciones pongan en la isla para proteger a sus trabajadores y al resto de la comunidad.\u0026nbsp; Por último, si alguno de ustedes tiene síntomas o cree que ha estado expuesto a alguien con COVID, por favor llamen al Cuerpo de Reservas Médicas al (844) 469-4554 para que podamos asesorar su riesgo y facilitar el hacer una prueba.

Before wildfire strikes, homeowners can help protect lives and property by creating a fire-adapted space around structures.Top 8 tips for maintaining a wildfire safety zone in the 30 feet around your homeRemove all dead plant material from around your home. Rake up dry leaves (under decks and porches too!) and move firewood away from the house. Keep your roof and gutters clear of flammable debris.\nPlace a 3 to 5-foot swath of gravel or stones around the foundation of your home instead of flammable mulch.\nPrune branches that overhang or touch the house. Take out \"ladder fuels,\" vegetation between grass and treetops that can carry fire between foliage and structures.\u0026nbsp; Keep blowing embers out of your house. Cover exterior vents with fine (1/8-inch) mesh. Store flammable materials, including cushions, indoors instead of on porches and decks.\nUse fire-resistant construction materials such as Class-A asphalt shingles, metal or concrete products for your roof. Use fire-resistant plants in the garden. Read our list of fire-resistant plants for the Puget Sound Basin (PDF), or search our illustrated online Native Plant Guide for fire-resistant plants. - Copied from https://kingcounty.gov/services/environment/water-and-land/forestry/forestfire.aspx\u0026nbsp;– which has MORE details and information.

  "content":"\nJuly 14: COVID-19 is on the rise in King County and Vashon's case count has jumped by four cases in the last several days to a total of 125 since the pandemic began last year. That remains a good record compared to the other King County communities, an infection rate about one-third of the county as a whole. However, the trends are cause for concern and one of the new Vashon cases gives us an important reality check, a breakthrough infection of a vaccinated patient.\"We may feel we are done with COVID, but COVID isn't done with us. We still have COVID on Vashon,\" explained Dr. Zach Miller, an infectious disease expert and leader of the contact tracing team for the Vashon Medical Reserve Corps. \"About 10% of our population aged 12 or more is unvaccinated, and that's not counting all the younger kids who are not yet eligible to get the vaccine,\" Dr. Miller emphasized.It's also important to remember that COVID-19 vaccines are about 90% effective at preventing disease for fully vaccinated people. That leaves another 10% of Vashon residents who are at risk of catching the disease, even though they are vaccinated. We have had at least one of these \"breakthrough\" cases on Vashon and they will continue to occur. So, even though the vaccines are almost 100% effective at preventing serious disease and hospitalization, you can still get sick, pass the disease on to others, and potentially face long haul effects from COVID.\"If you add up these two factors, well over 2,000 Vashon residents are still at risk, about 20% of our neighbors and family members,\" Dr. Miller emphasized.Here are steps you can take:· Get fully vaccinated. It's the very best COVID prevention tool we have. If you've got your first dose, complete the course and get full protection. · If you have symptoms, don't wait. Get tested right away and quarantine yourself so you don't spread the disease. · Listen to your gut if you are going into a situation where you are exposed to people you don't know. You can make the choice to mask and distance. · Be extra careful if you travel, even for essential purposes. Most Vashon cases continue to be related to travel outside our area. If you test positive or believe you've been exposed to someone who has tested positive, contact the Vashon Medical Reserve Corps hotline at (844) 469-4554.[-- updated 14 Jun 5:27pm] "},{

  "content":" Click map for a larger version\nIn January, the Washington Geological Survey (WGS) published a new set of maps derived from their “inundation models […] based on the shape of the ocean floor, the topography of the land, and the expected size and shape of tsunami waves. These properties are derived from what we know about past earthquakes and tsunamis that are found in the geologic record of the Pacific Northwest. The result of the modeling is a series of maps that show the expected depth of water and the speed of the currents from an earthquake-generated tsunami.”Click here to download DNR’s new tsunami hazard maps of the Puget Sound and adjacent waters (Map Series 2021-01). The last file in the zip includes the report.\nNote that this is a large (70MB) file and may take some time to download.\nNew tsunami modeling using a large earthquake scenario along the Cascadia subduction zone is now available for all areas within the Puget Sound and parts of the Strait of Georgia, some of which had not been modeled before.\nThis modeling uses a simulated magnitude 9.0 earthquake that produces a tsunami that is unlikely to be exceeded in the next great earthquake. The intent of the modeling is to encourage hazard planning and increase community resilience. The earthquake scenario presented here is based on one that was recently used to estimate the hazard posed to Oregon by tsunamis. However, because tsunamis generated offshore must enter through the Strait of Juan de Fuca to reach Washington’s inner coastline, our scenario adopts a fault geometry that extends farther north than the one used for Oregon. This extension better represents a tsunami generated offshore of northern Washington. The updated subduction zone geometry assumes a full-length rupture that spans ~775 mi from northern California to the northern end of Vancouver Island, Canada. Scientists inferred that this scenario encompasses ~95 percent of the variability of Cascadia tsunami simulations. Modeling results indicate that the tsunami would first arrive in all inner coastal waterway locations as a trough, with sea level gradually receding.\nThe first tsunami wave generated by the earthquake would arrive on the west side of Whidbey Island approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes after the earthquake, with large wave crests in excess of 16 ft (5 m) traveling north into the Strait of Georgia and south through Puget Sound. Most other locations within Puget Sound and parts of the Strait of Georgia would encounter this first tsunami wave within 2–4 hours of the earthquake, leaving little time to issue official warnings, although any felt earthquake shaking is an immediate warning. Fast moving currents from the tsunami waves could locally exceed 9 knots in multiple harbors, inlets, and passages within the narrow waterways of Washington’s inner coastline, presenting a significant navigational hazard to the maritime community. Tsunami wave inundation would likely continue over 14 hours and remain hazardous to maritime operations for more than 24 hours. This study is limited in that modeling does not account for tide stage, tidal currents, earthquake-induced landslides, seiches, liquefaction, or minor topographic changes that would locally modify the effects of tsunami waves. In addition, there are many assumptions associated with the scenario earthquake and its probability of occurrence modeled here. Due to these limitations, this modeling is unsuitable for site-specific tsunami inundation assessment or for determining effects on the built environment. Instead, we recommend using this modeling as a tool to assist with emergency preparations and evacuation planning prior to a Cascadia subduction zone event.”\n– Abstract from Tsunami Hazard Maps of the Puget Sound and Adjacent Waters—Model Results from an extended L1 Mw 9.0 Cascadia Subduction Zone Megathrust Earthquake Scenario\u0026nbsp; ger_ms2021-01_tsunami_hazard_puget_sound_pamphlet.pdf\nA little more dramatic is their 2019 tsunami videos, available on DNR’s YouTube channel at: https://bit.ly/2UakcB8\nMore tsunami information is at: https://www.dnr.wa.gov/tsunami\n…or at VashonBePrepared’s tsunami page.\n"},{

  "content":"A new report from the Food \u0026amp; Agriculture Organization of the United Nations paints a somber picture for agrarian communities.\nReportedly, disasters happen three times more often today, than in the 1970s and 1980s. Agriculture absorbs a disproportionate 63 per cent share of their impact, compared to other sectors, such as tourism, commerce and industry.\nNew hazards such as megafires, extreme weather, unusually large desert locust swarms, and emerging biological threats threaten agri-food systems.\nAbstract\nOn top of a decade of exacerbated disaster loss, exceptional global heat, retreating ice and rising sea levels, humanity and our food security face a range of new and unprecedented hazards, such as megafires, extreme weather events, desert locust swarms of magnitudes previously unseen, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Agriculture underpins the livelihoods of over 2.5 billion people – most of them in low-income developing countries – and remains a key driver of development. At no other point in history has agriculture been faced with such an array of familiar and unfamiliar risks, interacting in a hyperconnected world and a precipitously changing landscape. And agriculture continues to absorb a disproportionate share of the damage and loss wrought by disasters. Their growing frequency and intensity, along with the systemic nature of risk, are upending people’s lives, devastating livelihoods, and jeopardizing our entire food system. This report makes a powerful case for investing in resilience and disaster risk reduction – especially data gathering and analysis for evidence informed action – to ensure agriculture’s crucial role in achieving the future we want.Read online the interactive storyClick the image of the report (above) to read the full report "},{

  "content":"Washington Good Samaritan law protects the general public during some activities even outside declared emergencies. Some aspects of the law are being reconsidered:The current Washington State Good Samaritan Law covers only medical aid given in times of a disaster. There is no provision for the general population to have Good Samaritan protection should they want to help their neighbors in the response to a significant event outside of a clear medical context.In 2021, a new bill has been sponsored to add an addition to the existing law and is currently moving through the House. The requested addition extends the existing law to include non-medical aid given in times of disaster. Important note: this would be beneficial in response to all hazards, including flooding, landslides, and wildfires, and is not specific only to an earthquake scenario.Key Points:Emergency Managers throughout the State of Washington work to help their residents prepare for disaster and build community resilience as their resources will be overwhelmed in a major disaster. The Good Samaritan Law as written currently covers only medical assistance. In a major disaster, if neighbors are going to help neighbors, as is promoted by emergency management across the state, then the state should extend the law and its liability coverage to those volunteers. CERT programs, medical and first responders, as well other emergency worker volunteer teams will NOT be affected by this change, and will provide those teams with more willing and protected people who will help them in a disaster. There is precedent by other States for this addition to the Good Samaritan Law.

  "content":"For this Sunday’s 20th anniversary of the Nisqually Earthquake, the University of Washington has created created a simulation based on that historic quake.\nThey will use this simulation as an initial test of the region’s new Early Earthquake Warning System.\nYou can learn how to opt-in to these new alerts by going to: https://mil.wa.gov/alerts\nTo receive this test message, you need to:Be physically located in King, Pierce or Thurston counties Have WEA 2.0 or 3.0 capable devices that are powered on Have OPTED IN to receive WEA test messagesGet Involved\nAfter opting in, we invite you to provide feedback — including reporting whether and how the test alert was delivered to your device.Sign up here to join a virtual WEA Watch Party between 10:30 and 11:15 a.m., Feb. 25. At this virtual event, facilitated by ShakeAlert® scientists and educators, you will have the opportunity to learn more about ShakeAlert®, participate in the WEA test and contribute feedback and citizen-science data that will help improve future alert delivery. Take the participation survey created jointly by our agency, the Joint Centre for Disaster Research at Massey University in New Zealand and the U.S. Geological Survey. Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary and you may elect to refuse to answer any question in the survey or choose to withdraw from the study at any time. What is the Earthquake Early Warning system and when will it come to Washington?Our state hopes to have an Earthquake Early Warning system powered by ShakeAlert® open for public use in May of 2021. The ShakeAlert® Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system in Washington state will be providing public alerts in May of 2021. Our partners on the West Coast have been working on earthquake early warning for quite some time as the monitoring system continues to be expanded and testing continues.\nThe ShakeAlert® Earthquake Early Warning system quickly detects earthquakes after they have already begun.If an earthquake fits the right profile of magnitude and shaking intensity, the US Geological Survey (USGS) issues a ShakeAlert Message and makes it available to distribution partners, like WEA, who deliver alerts to areas that could feel weak or greater shaking.\nThis may potentially provide people seconds to protect themselves, such as drop, cover and hold on.\nThe Earthquake Early Warning system is already operational for some automatic action systems such as water and utility valve shut off and public address systems. The Earthquake Early Warning system detects earthquakes quickly, so alerts can be delivered to trigger automated actions, such as slowing a train, opening fire station doors, or telling people to take protective action before shaking begins. ShakeAlert® messages are sent from the U.S. Geological Survey and are delivered to mobile devices on several different systems.\nIf shaking is expected at your location, you may get a Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) on your mobile device, just like an AMBER alert, or you may get an alert as a public announcement. The Wireless Emergency Alert system broadcasts public safety messages over the commercial cellular system.\nMessages are sent by alerting authorities through the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS), which confirms messages before sending them to commercial mobile service providers for distribution to customers.\nShakeAlert® does not predict when or where an earthquake will occur or how long it will last. Depending on your location, alerts may not occur before shaking begins. It takes time for alerts to be delivered to a mobile device, so areas closest to the earthquake epicenter may not receive an alert.\nAs soon as you feel shaking, or get an alert, take protective action: Drop, cover, and hold on. The system does not tell you when shaking will start nor how strong the shaking will be. When you receive an alert, take action to protect yourself immediately!\nShakeAlert infrastructure is already in place along most of the West Coast, and is operational for automatic-action systems such as water utility valve shutoffs and starting back-up generators. It can also prevent cascading failures in the aftermath of an event. For example, isolating utilities before shaking starts can reduce the number of fire initiations\nIn the case of a real earthquake, what would a WEA alert look like?\nAll WEA alerts, regardless of type, behave the same. The device makes a distinctive notification sound and the message pops up in a text window on the screen.\nSome devices with text-to-voice capability may read out the message text.\nWhen you receive a real alert, the message will say:\nEnglish: Earthquake Detected! Drop, Cover, Hold On. Protect Yourself. -USGS ShakeAlertSpanish: Terremoto detectado! Agachese, cubrase, sujetese. Protejase. -USGS ShakeAlertIt is important that you use the time to take protective action, such as drop, cover and hold on. The system does not tell you when shaking will start nor how strong the shaking will be. When you receive an alert, take action to protect yourself immediately!These videos provide more information and tips to take protective action: Learn how the Earthquake Early Warning system works via PNSN and the official ShakeAlert® page.

  "content":"The Double Disaster: When the pandemic struck, it quickly became clear that our island community faced two emergencies. First, there was the need to fight the disease, help people understand how to keep themselves and their families safe. Second, our community was being hit by a devastating economic and emotional disaster.Islanders at Emotional Risk: At peak, a quarter of all Vashon workers had applied for unemployment benefits. A Chamber of Commerce survey showed that 40% of our businesses went dark. Schools sent kids home. Hundreds of families are worrying about getting enough food, keeping a home, and making choices between safety and essential work paychecks. Isolated seniors are descending into loneliness and depression. Island social service agencies are seeing increased substance abuse and household violence.\nOur Suicide Prevention Campaign: To help address these risks, the Vashon Community Care Team has built a Vashon suicide prevention campaign with two simultaneous tracks. We will raise public awareness and understanding. At the same time, we will support the work of mental health providers and social service agencies by offering advanced training, helping them be a vital safety net for those seeking help.\n· In the next few weeks you will see major community visibility as we promote our anchor event, “Tales from the Edge: Suicide Survivors Share Their Stories.”· On September 10th, live from Vashon Center for the Arts, Susan McCabe will talk with suicide survivors in a live streaming event (poster attached). It’s not a fundraiser. It’s free.· We are basing the campaign on the University of Washington L.E.A.R.N. program. Our community will learn how to recognize the signs, what to say, and how to help.· Building on increased awareness, we will follow up on the launch event with intensive public education, including an all island postcard mailing with phone numbers to get help.· At the same time, through special arrangement with the L.E.A.R.N. program, we will be offering — at no charge —online courses for practitioners, partner staff and volunteers, as well as people likely to encounter those in need (e.g., physical therapists, hair cutters, etc.)\nWhat Partners Do: We ask partner groups to join this effort. Clearly, there’s a strong linkage between the full range of mental health issues and suicide. Going after one, will go after all of them. Here’s what we ask from partners.\n· Allow us the use of your organization’s name and logo to show you are a partner.· Join us by publicizing our campaign through your own social media, push email and website channels — especially our impending campaign launch event.· Be available for news releases and other communications to share perspectives on the importance of suicide awareness and prevention.· Encourage your team to be part of this community wide effort by distributing our L.E.A.R.N. postcards and by taking the free training.\nA project of Vashon’s Community Care Team, a unit of the Vashon Medical Reserve Corps\nMore details:\nhttps://vashonbeprepared.org/en-us/COVID-Resources/For-Our-Mental-Health/Fall-Suicide-Prevention-Campaign\n"},{

  "content":"The following is a great post recommended by Vashon’s Jinna Risdal, PhD, and the original link (with diagrams) is at:\nhttps://www.erinbromage.com/post/the-risks-know-them-avoid-them\nUpdated: May 20\nPlease read this link to learn about the author and background to these posts.It seems many people are breathing some relief, and I’m not sure why. An epidemic curve has a relatively predictable upslope and once the peak is reached, the back slope can also be predicted. We have robust data from the outbreaks in China and Italy, that shows the backside of the mortality curve declines slowly, with deaths persisting for months. Assuming we have just crested in deaths at 70k, it is possible that we lose another 70,000 people over the next 6 weeks as we come off that peak. That's what's going to happen with a lockdown. As states reopen, and we give the virus more fuel, all bets are off. I understand the reasons for reopening the economy, but I've said before, if you don't solve the biology, the economy won't recover. There are very few states that have demonstrated a sustained decline in numbers of new infections. Indeed, as of May 3rd the majority are still increasing and reopening. As a simple example of the USA trend, when you take out the data from New York and just look at the rest of the USA, daily case numbers are increasing. Bottom line: the only reason the total USA new case numbers look flat right now is because the New York City epidemic was so large and now it is being contained. (as of May 3rd)So throughout most of the country we are going to add fuel to the viral fire by reopening. It's going to happen if I like it or not, so my goal here is to try to guide you away from situations of high risk. Where are people getting sick? We know most people get infected in their own home. A household member contracts the virus in the community and brings it into the house where sustained contact between household members leads to infection.But where are people contracting the infection in the community? I regularly hear people worrying about grocery stores, bike rides, inconsiderate runners who are not wearing masks.... are these places of concern? Well, not really. Let me explain.In order to get infected you need to get exposed to an infectious dose of the virus; based on infectious dose studies with other coronaviruses, it appears that only small doses may be needed for infection to take hold. Some experts estimate that as few as 1000 SARS-CoV2 infectious viral particles are all that will be needed (ref 1, ref 2). Please note, this still needs to be determined experimentally, but we can use that number to demonstrate how infection can occur. Infection could occur, through 1000 infectious viral particles you receive in one breath or from one eye-rub, or 100 viral particles inhaled with each breath over 10 breaths, or 10 viral particles with 100 breaths. Each of these situations can lead to an infection.How much Virus is released into the environment?A Bathroom: Bathrooms have a lot of high touch surfaces, door handles, faucets, stall doors. So fomite transfer risk in this environment can be high. We still do not know whether a person releases infectious material in feces or just fragmented virus, but we do know that toilet flushing does aerosolize many droplets. Treat public bathrooms with extra caution (surface and air), until we know more about the risk. A Cough: A single cough releases about 3,000 droplets and droplets travels at 50 miles per hour. Most droplets are large, and fall quickly (gravity), but many do stay in the air and can travel across a room in a few seconds. A Sneeze: A single sneeze releases about 30,000 droplets, with droplets traveling at up to 200 miles per hour. Most droplets are small and travel great distances (easily across a room).If a person is infected, the droplets in a single cough or sneeze may contain as many as 200,000,000 (two hundred million) virus particles which can all be dispersed into the environment around them.A breath: A single breath releases 50 - 5000 droplets. Most of these droplets are low velocity and fall to the ground quickly. There are even fewer droplets released through nose-breathing. Importantly, due to the lack of exhalation force with a breath, viral particles from the lower respiratory areas are not expelled. Unlike sneezing and coughing which release huge amounts of viral material, the respiratory droplets released from breathing only contain low levels of virus. We don't have a number for SARS-CoV2 yet, but we can use influenza as a guide. Studies have shown that a person infected with influenza can releases up to 33 infectious viral particles per minute. But I'm going to use 20 to keep the math simple.Remember the formula: Successful Infection = Exposure to Virus x TimeIf a person coughs or sneezes, those 200,000,000 viral particles go everywhere. Some virus hangs in the air, some falls into surfaces, most falls to the ground. So if you are face-to-face with a person, having a conversation, and that person sneezes or coughs straight at you, it's pretty easy to see how it is possible to inhale 1,000 virus particles and become infected.But even if that cough or sneeze was not directed at you, some infected droplets--the smallest of small--can hang in the air for a few minutes, filling every corner of a modest sized room with infectious viral particles. All you have to do is enter that room within a few minutes of the cough/sneeze and take a few breaths and you have potentially received enough virus to establish an infection. But with general breathing, 20 viral particles minute into the environment, even if every virus ended up in your lungs (which is very unlikely), you would need 1000 viral particles divided by 20 per minute = 50 minutes.Speaking increases the release of respiratory droplets about 10 fold; ~200 virus particles per minute. Again, assuming every virus is inhaled, it would take ~5 minutes of speaking face-to-face to receive the required dose. The exposure to virus x time formula is the basis of contact tracing. Anyone you spend greater than 10 minutes with in a face-to-face situation is potentially infected. Anyone who shares a space with you (say an office) for an extended period is potentially infected. This is also why it is critical for people who are symptomatic to stay home. Your sneezes and your coughs expel so much virus that you can infect a whole room of people. What is the role of asymptomatic people in spreading the virus? Symptomatic people are not the only way the virus is shed. We know that at least 44% of all infections--and the majority of community-acquired transmissions--occur from people without any symptoms (asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic people). You can be shedding the virus into the environment for up to 5 days before symptoms begin.Infectious people come in all ages, and they all shed different amounts of virus. The figure below shows that no matter your age (x-axis), you can have a little bit of virus or a lot of virus (y-axis). (ref) The amount of virus released from an infected person changes over the course of infection and it is also different from person-to-person. Viral load generally builds up to the point where the person becomes symptomatic. So just prior to symptoms showing, you are releasing the most virus into the environment. Interestingly, the data shows that just 20% of infected people are responsible for 99% of viral load that could potentially be released into the environment (ref)So now let’s get to the crux of it. Where are the personal dangers from reopening? When you think of outbreak clusters, what are the big ones that come to mind? Most people would say cruise ships. But you would be wrong. Ship outbreaks, while concerning, don’t land in the top 50 outbreaks to date. Ignoring the terrible outbreaks in nursing homes, we find that the biggest outbreaks are in prisons, religious ceremonies, and workplaces, such as meat packing facilities and call centers. Any environment that is enclosed, with poor air circulation and high density of people, spells trouble. Some of the biggest super-spreading events are: Meat packing: In meat processing plants, densely packed workers must communicate to one another amidst the deafening drum of industrial machinery and a cold-room virus-preserving environment. There are now outbreaks in 115 facilities across 23 states, 5000+ workers infected, with 20 dead. (ref)\nWeddings, funerals, birthdays: 10% of early spreading events\nBusiness networking: Face-to-face business networking like the Biogen Conference in Boston in late February. As we move back to work, or go to a restaurant, let’s look at what can happen in those environments. Restaurants: Some really great shoe-leather epidemiology demonstrated clearly the effect of a single asymptomatic carrier in a restaurant environment (see below). The infected person (A1) sat at a table and had dinner with 9 friends. Dinner took about 1 to 1.5 hours. During this meal, the asymptomatic carrier released low-levels of virus into the air from their breathing. Airflow (from the restaurant's various airflow vents) was from right to left. Approximately 50% of the people at the infected person's table became sick over the next 7 days. 75% of the people on the adjacent downwind table became infected. And even 2 of the 7 people on the upwind table were infected (believed to happen by turbulent airflow). No one at tables E or F became infected, they were out of the main airflow from the air conditioner on the right to the exhaust fan on the left of the room. (Ref) Workplaces: Another great example is the outbreak in a call center (see below). A single infected employee came to work on the 11th floor of a building. That floor had 216 employees. Over the period of a week, 94 of those people became infected (43.5%: the blue chairs). 92 of those 94 people became sick (only 2 remained asymptomatic). Notice how one side of the office is primarily infected, while there are very few people infected on the other side. While exact number of people infected by respiratory droplets / respiratory exposure versus fomite transmission (door handles, shared water coolers, elevator buttons etc.) is unknown. It serves to highlight that being in an enclosed space, sharing the same air for a prolonged period increases your chances of exposure and infection. Another 3 people on other floors of the building were infected, but the authors were not able to trace the infection to the primary cluster on the 11th floor. Interestingly, even though there were considerable interaction between workers on different floors of the building in elevators and the lobby, the outbreak was mostly limited to a single floor (ref). This highlights the importance of exposure and time in the spreading of SARS-CoV2. Choir: The community choir in Washington State. Even though people were aware of the virus and took steps to minimize transfer; e.g. they avoided the usual handshakes and hugs hello, people also brought their own music to avoid sharing, and socially distanced themselves during practice. They even went to the lengths to tell choir members prior to practice that anyone experiencing symptoms should stay home. A single asymptomatic carrier infected most of the people in attendance. The choir sang for 2 1/2 hours, inside an enclosed rehearsal hall which was roughly the size of a volleyball court. Singing, to a greater degree than talking, aerosolizes respiratory droplets extraordinarily well. Deep-breathing while singing facilitated those respiratory droplets getting deep into the lungs. Two and half hours of exposure ensured that people were exposed to enough virus over a long enough period of time for infection to take place. Over a period of 4 days, 45 of the 60 choir members developed symptoms, 2 died. The youngest infected was 31, but they averaged 67 years old. (corrected link)Indoor sports: While this may be uniquely Canadian, a super spreading event occurred during a curling event in Canada. A curling event with 72 attendees became another hotspot for transmission. Curling brings contestants and teammates in close contact in a cool indoor environment, with heavy breathing for an extended period. This tournament resulted in 24 of the 72 people becoming infected. (ref)Birthday parties / funerals: Just to see how simple infection-chains can be, this is a real story from Chicago. The name is fake. Bob was infected but didn't know. Bob shared a takeout meal, served from common serving dishes, with 2 family members. The dinner lasted 3 hours. The next day, Bob attended a funeral, hugging family members and others in attendance to express condolences. Within 4 days, both family members who shared the meal are sick. A third family member, who hugged Bob at the funeral became sick. But Bob wasn't done. Bob attended a birthday party with 9 other people. They hugged and shared food at the 3 hour party. Seven of those people became ill.But Bob’s transmission chain wasn’t done. Three of the people Bob infected at the birthday went to church, where they sang, passed the tithing dish etc. Members of that church became sick. In all, Bob was directly responsible for infecting 16 people between the ages of 5 and 86. Three of those 16 died. The spread of the virus within the household and back out into the community through funerals, birthdays, and church gatherings is believed to be responsible for the broader transmission of COVID-19 in Chicago. (ref)Sobering right?Commonality of outbreaksThe reason to highlight these different outbreaks is to show you the commonality of outbreaks of COVID-19. All these infection events were indoors, with people closely-spaced, with lots of talking, singing, or yelling. The main sources for infection are home, workplace, public transport, social gatherings, and restaurants. This accounts for 90% of all transmission events. In contrast, outbreaks spread from shopping appear to be responsible for a small percentage of traced infections. (Ref)Importantly, of the countries performing contact tracing properly, only a single outbreak has been reported from an outdoor environment (less than 0.3% of traced infections). (ref)So back to the original thought of my post. Indoor spaces, with limited air exchange or recycled air and lots of people, are concerning from a transmission standpoint. We know that 60 people in a volleyball court-sized room (choir) results in massive infections. Same situation with the restaurant and the call center. Social distancing guidelines don't hold in indoor spaces where you spend a lot of time, as people on the opposite side of the room were infected. The principle is viral exposure over an extended period of time. In all these cases, people were exposed to the virus in the air for a prolonged period (hours). Even if they were 50 feet away (choir or call center), even a low dose of the virus in the air reaching them, over a sustained period, was enough to cause infection and in some cases, death. Social distancing rules are really to protect you with brief exposures or outdoor exposures. In these situations there is not enough time to achieve the infectious viral load when you are standing 6 feet apart or where wind and the infinite outdoor space for viral dilution reduces viral load. The effects of sunlight, heat, and humidity on viral survival, all serve to minimize the risk to everyone when outside.When assessing the risk of infection (via respiration) at the grocery store or mall, you need to consider the volume of the air space (very large), the number of people (restricted), how long people are spending in the store (workers - all day; customers - an hour). Taken together, for a person shopping: the low density, high air volume of the store, along with the restricted time you spend in the store, means that the opportunity to receive an infectious dose is low. But, for the store worker, the extended time they spend in the store provides a greater opportunity to receive the infectious dose and therefore the job becomes more risky. Basically, as the work closures are loosened, and we start to venture out more, possibly even resuming in-office activities, you need to look at your environment and make judgments. How many people are here, how much airflow is there around me, and how long will I be in this environment. If you are in an open floorplan office, you really need to critically assess the risk (volume, people, and airflow). If you are in a job that requires face-to-face talking or even worse, yelling, you need to assess the risk. If you are sitting in a well ventilated space, with few people, the risk is low. If I am outside, and I walk past someone, remember it is “dose and time” needed for infection. You would have to be in their airstream for 5+ minutes for a chance of infection. While joggers may be releasing more virus due to deep breathing, remember the exposure time is also less due to their speed. Please do maintain physical distance, but the risk of infection in these scenarios are low. Here is a great article in Vox that discusses the low risk of running and cycling in detail. While I have focused on respiratory exposure here, please don't forget surfaces. Those infected respiratory droplets land somewhere. Wash your hands often and stop touching your face!As we are allowed to move around our communities more freely and be in contact with more people in more places more regularly, the risks to ourselves and our family are significant. Even if you are gung-ho for reopening and resuming business as usual, do your part and wear a mask to reduce what you release into the environment. It will help everyone, including your own business.

  "content":"The White House attempted to bury CDC’s scientific guidance, but it was made public though a leak.\nHere is the full text of the Draft COVID-19 reopening guidance from CDC, titled “Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework”. Or as a PDF document.\nInterim Guidance for Child Care Programs The reopening of child care programs is crucial to helping parents and guardians return to work. Many States have closed schools for the academic year and, with summer quickly approaching, an increasing number of working parents may need to rely on these programs. CDC’s Interim Guidance for Administrators of US K-12 Schools and Child Care Programs and supplemental Guidance for Child Care Programs that Remain Open provide recommendations for operating child care programs in low, moderate, and significant mitigation communities. In communities that are deemed significant mitigation areas by State and local authorities, child care programs should be closed. However, child care programs can choose to remain open to serve children of essential workers, such as healthcare workers. All decisions about following these recommendations should be made locally, in collaboration with local health officials who can help determine levels of COVID-19 community transmission and the capacities of the local public health system and healthcare systems. (Re) Opening o In all Phases: o Establish and continue communication with local and State authorities to determine current mitigation levels in your community.o Protect and support staff, children, and their family members who are at higher risk for severe illness. o Provide staff from higher transmission areas (earlier Phase areas) telework and other options as feasible to eliminate travel to childcare programs in lower transmission (later Phase) areas and vice versa.o Follow CDC’s supplemental Guidance for Child Care Programs that Remain Open. o Ensure that any other community groups or organizations that use the child care facilities also follow this guidance: Guidance for Child Care Programs that Remain Open.o Phase 1: Restrict to children of essential workers in areas needing significant mitigation. o Phase 2: Expand to all children with enhanced social distancing measures. o Phase 3: Remain open for all children with social distancing measures. Safety ActionsPromote healthy hygiene practices (Phases 1-3) o Teach and reinforce washing hands and covering coughs and sneezes among children and staff.o Teach and reinforce use of cloth face coverings among all staff. Face coverings are most essential at times when social distancing is not possible. Staff should be frequently reminded not to touch the face covering and to wash their hands frequently. Information should be provided to all staff on proper use, removal, and washing of cloth face coverings.o Have adequate supplies to support healthy hygiene behaviors, including soap, hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer), and tissues. o Post signs on how to stop the spread of COVID-19, properly wash hands, promote everyday protective measures, and properly wear a face covering.Intensify cleaning, disinfection, and ventilation (Phases 1-3) o Clean, sanitize, and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (for example, playground equipment, door handles, sink handles, drinking fountains) multiple times per day. and shared objects between use. o Avoid use of items (for example, soft or plush toys) that are not easily cleaned, sanitized, or disinfected. o Ensure safe and correct application of disinfectants and keep products away from children.o Ensure that ventilation systems operate properly and increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible by opening windows and doors, using fans, and other methods. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk (for example, allowing pollens in or exacerbating asthma symptoms) to children using the facility.o Take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (for example, drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown to minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated with water.Ensure social distancing o Phase 1 and 2 o Ensure that classes include the same group of children each day, and that the same child care providers remain with the same group each day. o Restrict mixing between groups o Cancel all field trips, inter-group events, and extracurricular activities (Phase 1) o Limit gatherings, events, and extracurricular activities to those that can maintain social distancing, support proper hand hygiene, and restrict attendance of those from higher transmission areas (Phase 2; Note: restricting attendance from those in Phase 1 areas).o Restrict nonessential visitors, volunteers, and activities involving other groups at the same time. o Space out seating and bedding (head-to-toe positioning) to six feet apart if possible. o Close communal use spaces, such as game rooms or dining halls, if possible; if this is not possible, stagger use and disinfect in between uses.o If a cafeteria or group dining room is typically used, serve meals in classrooms instead. Put each child’s meal on a plate, to limit the use of shared serving utensils. o Stagger arrival and drop-off times or put in place other protocols to limit direct contact with parents as much as possible. o Phase 3o Consider keeping classes together to include the same group of children each day, and consider keeping the same child care providers with the same group each day.o Allow minimal mixing between groups. Limit gatherings, events, and extracurricular activities to those that can maintain social distancing, support proper hand hygiene, and restrict attendance of those from higher transmission areas (Phase 1 or 2 areas).o Continue to space out seating and bedding (head-to-toe positioning) to six feet apart, if possible.o Consider keeping communal use spaces closed, such as game rooms, playgrounds, or dining halls, if possible; if this is not possible, stagger use and disinfect in between uses.o Consider continuing to plate each child’s meal, to limit the use of shared serving utensils. o Consider limiting nonessential visitors, volunteers, and activities involving other groups. Restrict attendance of those from higher transmission areas (Phase 1 or 2 areas).o Consider staggering arrival and drop-off times or put in place other protocols to limit direct contact with parents as much as possible. Limit sharing (Phases 1-3) o Keep each child’s belongings separated and in individually labeled storage containers, cubbies, or areas or taken home each day and cleaned. o Ensure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high touch materials to the extent possible (art supplies, equipment etc. assigned to a single camper) or limit use of supplies and equipment by one group of children at a time and clean and disinfect between use. o If food is offered at any event, have pre-packaged boxes or bags for each attendee instead of a buffet or family-style meal. Avoid sharing of foods and utensils.o Avoid sharing electronic devices, toys, books, other games, and learning aids. o Prevent risk of transmitting COVID-19 by avoiding immediate contact (such as shaking or holding hands, hugging, or kissing), as well as by mediated contact. Train all staff (Phases 1-3)o Train all staff in the above safety actions. Consider conducting the training virtually, or, if in-person, ensure social distancing is maintained. Monitoring and Preparing Check for signs and symptoms (Phases 1-3) o Screen children upon arrival, if possible. Establish routine, daily health checks on arrival, such as temperature screening of both staff and children. Options for daily health check screenings for children are provided in CDC’s supplemental Guidance for Child Care Programs that Remain Open and in CDC’s General Business FAQs for screening staff. o Implement health checks (e.g. temperature checks and symptom screening) screenings safely, and respectfully, and with measures in place to ensure confidentiality as well as in accordance with any applicable privacy laws or regulations. Confidentiality should be maintained. o Employers and child care directors may use examples of screening methods in CDC’s supplemental Guidance for Child Care Programs that Remain Open as a guide. o Encourage staff to stay home if they are sick and encourage parents to keep sick children home.Plan for when a staff member, child, or visitor becomes sick (Phases 1-3) o Identify an area to separate anyone who exhibits COVID-like symptoms during hours of operation, and ensure that children are not left without adult supervision. o Establish procedures for safely transporting anyone sick home or to a healthcare facility, as appropriate.o Notify local health officials, staff, and families immediately of any possible case of COVID-19 while maintaining confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). o Close off areas used by any sick person and do not use them until they have been cleaned. Wait 24 hours before you clean or disinfect to reduce risk to individuals cleaning. If it is not possible to wait 24 hours, wait as long as possible.Ensure safe and correct application of disinfectants and keep disinfectant products away from children o Advise sick staff members not to return until they have met CDC criteria to discontinue home isolation.o Inform anyone exposed to a person diagnosed with COVID-19 to stay home and self-monitor for symptoms, and to follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop. Maintain healthy operations (Phases 1-3) o Implement flexible sick leave policies and practices, if feasible. o Monitor absenteeism to identify any trends in employee or child absences due to illness. This might indicate spread of COVID-19 or other illness. Have a roster of trained back-up staff in order to maintain sufficient staffing levels.o Designate a staff person to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. Employees should know who this person is and how to contact them.o Create a communication system for staff and families for self-reporting of symptoms and notification of exposures and closures. Closing Phases 1-3 o It is very important to check State and local health department notices daily about spread of COVID-19 in the area and adjust operations accordingly.o Where a community is deemed a significant mitigation community, child care programs should close, except for those caring for the children of essential workers, such as the children of health care workers. o In the event a person diagnosed with COVID-19 is determined to have been in the building and poses a risk to the community, programs may consider closing for a few days for cleaning and disinfection. Interim Guidance for Schools and Day Camps As communities consider reopening centers for learning, such as K-12 schools and summer day camps, CDC offers the following recommendations to keep communities safe while resuming peer-to-peer learning and providing crucial support for parents and guardians returning to work. These recommendations depend on community monitoring to prevent COVID-19 from spreading. Communities with low levels of COVID-19 spread and those with confidence that the incidence of infection is genuinely low (e.g. communities that remain in low transmission or that have entered Phase two or three) may put in place the practices described below as part of a phased reopening. All decisions about following these recommendations should be made in collaboration with local health officials and other State and local authorities who can help assess the current level of mitigation needed based on levels of COVID-19 community transmission and the capacities of the local public health and healthcare systems, among other relevant factors. o Establish and continue communication with local and State authorities to determine current mitigation levels in your community. o Protect and support staff and students who are at higher risk for severe illness, such as providing options for telework and virtual learning. o Follow CDC’s Guidance for Schools and Childcare Programs.o Provide teachers and staff from higher transmission areas (earlier Phase areas) telework and other options as feasible to eliminate travel to schools and camps in lower transmission (later Phase) areas and vice versa.o Ensure external community organizations that use the facilities also follow this guidance.o Phase 1: Schools that are currently closed, remain closed. E-learning or distance learning opportunities should be provided for all students. Ensure provision of student services such as school meal programs. Camps restrict to children of essential workers and for children who live in the local geographic area only. o Phase 2: Remain open with enhanced social distancing measures and for children who live in the local geographic area only. o Phase3: Remain open with distancing measures. Restrict attendance to those from limited transmission areas (other Phase 3 areas) only.Safety Actions Promote healthy hygiene practices (Phases 1-3) o Teach and reinforce washing hands and covering coughs and sneezes among children and staff.o Teach and reinforce use of cloth face coverings among all staff. Face coverings are most essential in times when physical distancing is not possible. Staff should be frequently reminded not to touch the face covering and to wash their hands frequently. Information should be provided to all staff on proper use, removal, and washing of cloth face coverings.o Have adequate supplies to support healthy hygiene behaviors, including soap, hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer), tissues, and no-touch trash cans. o Post signs on how to stop the spread of COVID-19, properly wash hands, promote everyday protective measures, and properly wear a face covering. Intensify cleaning, disinfection, and ventilation (Phases 1-3) o Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces within the school and on school buses at least daily (for example, playground equipment, door handles, sink handles, drinking fountains) and shared objects (for example, toys, games, art supplies) between uses. o To clean and disinfect school buses see guidance for bus transit operators.o Ensure safe and correct application of disinfectants and keep products away from children.o Ensure ventilation systems operate properly and increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible by opening windows and doors, using fans, or other methods. Do not open windows and doors if they pose a safety or health risk (e.g., allowing pollens in or exacerbating asthma symptoms) risk to children using the facility.o Take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (for example, drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown to minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated with water.Ensure social distancingo Phase 1 and 2o Ensure that student and staff groupings are as static as possible by having the same group of children stay with the same staff (all day for young children, and as much as possible for older children).o Restrict mixing between groups o Cancel all field trips, inter-group events, and extracurricular activities (Phase 1)o Limit gatherings, events, and extracurricular activities to those that can maintain social distancing, support proper hand hygiene, and restrict attendance of those from higher transmission areas (Phase 2; Note: restricting attendance from those in Phase 1 areas). o Restrict nonessential visitors, volunteers, and activities involving other groups at the same time o Space seating/desks to at least six feet apart.o Close communal use spaces such as dining halls and playgrounds if possible; otherwise stagger use and disinfect in between use. o If a cafeteria or group dining room is typically used, serve meals in classrooms instead. Serve individually plated meals and hold activities in separate classrooms. Stagger arrival and drop-off times or locations, or put in place other protocols to limit direct contact with parents as much as possible. o Create social distance between children on school buses where possible. o Phase 3o Consider keeping classes together to include the same group of children each day, and consider keeping the same child care providers with the same group each day. o Allow minimal mixing between groups.

School nurses and other healthcare providers should use Standard and Transmission-Based Precautions when caring for sick people. See: What Healthcare Personnel Should Know About Caring for Patients with Confirmed or Possible COVID-19 Infection.o Establish procedures for safely transporting anyone sick home or to a healthcare facility.o Notify local health officials, staff, and families immediately of a possible case while maintaining confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).o Close off areas used by a sick person and do not use before cleaning and disinfection. Wait 24 hours before you clean and disinfect. If it is not possible to wait 24 hours is, wait as long as possible.

School nurses and other healthcare providers play an important role in monitoring health clinic traffic and the types of illnesses and symptoms among students. o Designate a staff person to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. Employees should know who this person is and how to contact them. o Create a communication systems for staff and families for self-reporting of symptoms and notification of exposures and closures. Closing Phases 1-3 o Check State and local health department notices daily about transmission in the area and adjust operations accordingly o In the event a person diagnosed with COVID-19 is determined to have been in the building and poses a risk to the community, programs may consider closing for a short time (1-2 days) for cleaning and disinfection.Interim Guidance for Communities of Faith CDC offers the following recommendations to help communities of faith continue their mission while keeping their staff and congregations safe. This guidance is not intended to infringe on First Amendment rights as provided in the US Constitution. As all Americans are now aware, gatherings present a special risk for increasing spread of COVID-19 during this Public Health Emergency. The federal government may not prescribe standards for interactions of faith communities in houses of worship and no faith community should be asked to adopt any mitigation strategies that are more stringent than the mitigation strategies asked of similarly situated entities or activities in accordance with the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act (RFRA). CDC offers these suggestions that faith communities may consider and accept or reject, consistent with their own faith traditions, in the course of preparing their own plans to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In communities deemed by CDC’s guidance to be significant mitigation areas, the risk to the larger community of continuing or resuming in-person gatherings should be taken into account and virtual options strongly considered. All decisions about following CDC’s recommendations should be made in collaboration with local health officials and other State and local authorities who can help assess the current level of mitigation needed based levels of COVID-19 community transmission and the capacities of the local public health and healthcare systems. CDC offers the following suggestions for consideration to the extent consistent with each community’s faith tradition: (Re) Opening o o Establish and continue communication with local and State authorities to determine current mitigation levels in your community. o Protect staff and congregants who are at higher risk for severe illness encouraging use of options to participate virtually, if possible.o Continue to provide congregants with spiritual and emotional care and counseling on a flexible or virtual basis, or refer them to other available resources.o Encourage other entities using the facilities to also follow this guidance. o If the facility offers child care or educational programming for children and youth, follow CDC guidance for such programs. o Phase 1: Limit gatherings to those that can be held virtually (by remote viewing) for vulnerable populations and consider video streaming or drive-in options for services. Limit the size of in person gatherings in accordance with the guidance and directives of state and local authorities, and maintain social distancing. o Phase 2: Consider continuing to hold gatherings virtually (by remote viewing) for vulnerable populations and video streaming or drive-in options for services. Limit the size of in person gatherings in accordance with the guidance and directives of state and local authorities, and maintain social distancing. o Phase 3: Limit gatherings to those that can maintain social distancing and consider video streaming or drive-in options for vulnerable populations. Safety Actions Promote healthy hygiene practices (Phases 1-3) o Encourage use of a cloth face covering at all gatherings and when in the building by everyone except children aged less than 2 years old. Not using a cloth face covering may also be appropriate at times for some individuals who have trouble breathing or need assistance to remove their mask.o Have adequate supplies to support healthy hygiene behaviors, including soap, hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer), tissues, and no-touch trash cans. o Consider posting signs on how to stop the spread of COVID-19 and promote everyday protective measures, such as washing hands and covering coughs and sneezes and properly wearing a face covering. Intensify cleaning, disinfection, and ventilation (Phases 1-3) o Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at least daily and shared objects between use. o Avoid use of items that are not easily cleaned, sanitized, or disinfected. o Ensure safe and correct application of disinfectants and keep them away from children. o Ensure that ventilation systems operate properly and increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible by opening windows and doors, using fans, etc. Do not open windows and doors if they pose a safety risk to children using the facility.o Take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (for example, drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown to minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated with water.Promote social distancing (Phases 1-3)o Limit the size of gatherings in accordance with the guidance and directives of state and local authorities and in accordance with RFRA. o Consider video streaming or drive-in options for services.o If appropriate and possible, add additional services to weekly schedules to maintain social distancing at each service, ensuring that clergy, staff, and volunteers at the services ensure social distancing to lessen their risk. o Consider holding services and gatherings in a large, well-ventilated area or outdoors, as circumstances and faith traditions allow.o Space out seating for attendees who do not live in the same household to at least six feet apart when possible; consider limiting seating to alternate rows. o Consider whether other gatherings may need to have attendance limited or be held virtually if social distancing is difficult, such as funerals, weddings, religious education classes, youth events, support groups and any other programming. o Avoid or consider suspending use of a choir or musical ensemble during religious services or other programming, if appropriate within the faith tradition. Consider having a soloist or strictly limiting the number of choir members and keep at least six feet between individuals. o Consider having clergy hold virtual visits (by phone or online) instead of in homes or at the hospital except for certain compassionate care situations, such as end of life. Limit community sharing of worship materials and other items (Phases 1-3) o Consider temporarily limiting the sharing of frequently touched objects, such as worship aids, prayer books, hymnals, religious texts and other bulletins, books or other items passed or shared among congregants, and encourage congregants to bring their own, if possible, photocopying, or projecting prayers, songs, and texts using electronic means. o Modify the methods used to receive financial contributions. Consider a stationary collection box, the mail, or electronic methods of collecting regular financial contributions instead of shared collection trays or baskets. o Consider mitigating the risk of transmitting COVID-19 posed by close physical contact among members of the faith community during religious rituals as well as mediated contact through frequently touched objects, consistent with the community’s faith traditions and in consultation with local health officials as needed.o If food is offered at any event, have pre-packaged boxes or bags for each attendee whenever possible, instead of a buffet or family-style meal.o Avoid food offerings when it is being shared from common dishes. Train all staff (Phases 1-3) o Train all clergy and staff in the above safety actions. Consider conducting the training virtually, or, if in-person, ensure that social distancing is maintained.Monitoring and Preparing Check for signs and symptoms (Phases 1-3) o Encourage staff or congregants who are sick to stay at home.Plan for when a staff member or congregant becomes sick (Phases 1-3) o Identify an area to separate anyone who exhibits COVID-like symptoms during hours of operation, and ensure that children are not left without adult supervision. o Establish procedures for safely transporting anyone who becomes sick at the facility to their home or a healthcare facility. o Notify local health officials if a person diagnosed with COVID-19 has been in the facility and communicate with staff and congregants about potential exposure while maintaining confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or other applicable laws an in accordance with religious practices.o Inform those with exposure to a person diagnosed with COVID-19 to stay home and self-monitor for symptoms, and follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop. Close off areas used by the sick person and do not use the area until it after cleaning and disinfection; wait 24 hours to clean and disinfect to reduce risk to individuals cleaning. If it is not possible to wait 24 hours, wait as long as possible before cleaning and disinfecting. Ensure safe and correct application of disinfectants and keep disinfectant products away from children. o Advise sick staff and congregants not to return to the facility until they have met CDC’s criteria to discontinue home isolation. Maintain healthy operations (Phases 1-3) o Implement flexible sick leave and related flexible policies and practices for staff (e.g., allow work from home, if feasible). o Monitor absenteeism and create a roster of trained back-up staff. Designate a staff person to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns. Employees should know who this person is and how to contact them.o Communicate clearly with staff and congregants about actions being taken to protect their health. Closing Phases 1-3 o Check state and local health department notices daily about transmission in the community and adjust operations accordingly. o In the event a person diagnosed with COVID-19 is determined to have been in the building and poses a risk to the community, it is strongly suggested to close, then properly clean and disinfect the area and the building where the individual was present. Interim Guidance for Employers with Vulnerable WorkersAs workplaces consider re-opening it is particularly important to keep in mind that some workers are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. These vulnerable workers include individuals over age 65 and those with underlying medical conditions. Such underlying conditions include, but are not limited to, chronic lung disease, moderate to severe asthma, hypertension, severe heart conditions, weakened immunity, severe obesity, diabetes, liver disease, and chronic kidney disease that requires dialysis. Vulnerable workers should be encouraged to self-identify, and employers should avoid making unnecessary medical inquiries. Employers should take particular care to reduce vulnerable workers’ risk of exposure to COVID-19, while making sure to be compliant with relevant ADA and ADEA regulations. First and foremost this means following CDC’s and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidance for reducing workplace exposure for all employees. All decisions about following these recommendations should be made in collaboration with local health officials and other State and local authorities who can help assess the current level of mitigation needed based on levels of COVID-19 community transmission and the capacities of the local public health and healthcare systems. In addition, the guidance offered below applies to workplaces generally; specific industries may require more stringent safety precautions. Finally, there may be essential workplaces in which the recommended mitigation strategies are not feasible.o Establish and continue communication with State and local authorities to determine current mitigation levels in your community.o Protect employees at higher risk for severe illness by supporting and encouraging options to telework.o Consider offering vulnerable workers duties that minimize their contact with customers and other employees (e.g., restocking shelves rather than working as a cashier), if agreed to by the worker. o Ensure that any other entities sharing the same work space also follow this guidance.o Provide employees from higher transmission areas (earlier Phase areas) telework and other options as feasible to eliminate travel to workplaces in lower transmission (later Phase) areas and vice versa.o Phase 1: Reopen only if business can ensure strict social distancing, proper cleaning and disinfecting requirements, and protection of their workers and customers; vulnerable workers are recommended to shelter in place.o Phase 2: Reopen only if business can ensure moderate social distancing, proper cleaning and disinfecting requirements, and protection of their workers and customers; vulnerable workers are recommended to shelter in place. o Phase 3: Reopen only if business can ensure limited social distancing, proper cleaning and disinfecting requirements, and protection of their workers and customers.Safety Actions Promote healthy hygiene practices (Phases 1-3) o Enforce hand washing, covering coughs and sneezes, and using cloth face coverings when around others where feasible; however, certain industries may require face shields. o Ensure that adequate supplies to support healthy hygiene behaviors, including soap, hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol, tissues, and no-touch trash cans.o Post signs on how to stop the spread of COVID-19, properly wash hands, promote everyday protective measures, and properly wear a face covering. Intensify cleaning, disinfection and ventilation (Phases 1-3) o Clean, sanitize, and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at least daily and shared objects between use. o Avoid use or sharing of items that are not easily cleaned, sanitized, or disinfected. o Ensure safe and correct application of disinfectants. o Ensure that ventilation systems operate properly and increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible by opening windows and doors, using fans, or other methods. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety risk to individuals and employees using the workspace.o Take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (for example, drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown to minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated with water.Ensure social distancing (Phases 1-3) o Limit service to drive-throughs, curbside take out, or delivery options, if possible (Phase 1). Consider installing physical barriers, such as sneeze guards and partitions, and changing workspace layouts to ensure all individuals remain at least six feet apart.o Close communal spaces, such as break rooms, if possible (Phase 1) or stagger use and clean and disinfect in between uses (Phases 2 \u0026amp; 3). o Encourage telework for as many employees as possible. o Consider rotating or staggering shifts to limit the number of employees in the workplace at the same time o Replace in-person meetings with video- or tele-conference calls whenever possible. o Cancel all group events, gatherings, or meetings of more than 10 people (Phase 1), of more than 50 people (Phase 2), and any events where social distancing of at least 6 feet cannot be maintained between participants (all Phases) o Restrict (Phase 1) or consider limiting (Phase 2) any nonessential visitors, volunteers, and activities involving external groups or organizations. o Limit any sharing of foods, tools, equipment, or supplies. Limit travel and modify commuting practices (Phases 1-3) o Cancel all non-essential travel (Phase 1) and consider resuming non-essential travel in accordance with state and local regulations and guidance (Phases 2 \u0026amp; 3) o Ask employees who use public transportation to consider using teleworking to promote social distancing o Train all managers and staff in the above safety actions. Consider conducting the training virtually, or if in-person, ensure that social distancing is maintained. Monitoring and Preparing Checking for signs and symptoms (Phases 1-3) o Consider conducting routine, daily health checks (e.g., temperature and symptom screening) of all employees. o If implementing health checks, conduct them safely and respectfully, and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations. Confidentiality should be respected. Employers may use examples of screening methods in CDC’s General Business FAQs as a guide. o and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations. Confidentiality should be respected.o Encourage employees who are sick to stay at home. Plan for when an employee becomes sick (Phases 1-3) o Employees with symptoms (fever, cough, or shortness of breath) at work should immediately be separated and sent home. o Establish procedures for safely transporting anyone sick to their home or to a healthcare facility.o Notify local health officials, staff, and customers (if possible) immediately of a possible case while maintaining confidentiality as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); other information on civil rights protections for workers related to COVID-19 is available here.o Close off areas used by the sick person until after cleaning and disinfection Wait 24 hours to clean and disinfect. If it is not possible to wait 24 hours, wait as long as possible before cleaning and disinfecting. Ensure safe and correct application of disinfectants and keep disinfectant products away from children.o Inform those who have had close contact with a person with COVID-19 to stay home and self-monitor for symptoms, and follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop.Maintain healthy operations (Phases 1-3) o Implement flexible sick leave and other flexible policies and practices, such as telework, if feasible. o Monitor absenteeism of employees and create a roster of trained back-up staff.o Designate a staff person to be responsible for responding to COVID-19 concerns.

Closing Phases 1-3 o Check State and local health department notices daily about transmission in the area and adjust operations accordingly. o Be prepared to close for a few days if there is a case of COVID-19 in the workplace or for longer if cases increase in the local area. Interim Guidance for Restaurants and BarsThis guidance provides considerations for businesses in the food service industry (e.g., restaurants and bars) on ways to maintain healthy business operations and a safe and healthy work environment for employees, while reducing the risk of COVID-19 spread for both employees and customers. Employers should follow applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and CDC guidance for businesses to plan and respond to COVID-19. All decisions about implementing these recommendations should be made in collaboration with local health officials and other State and local authorities who can help assess the current level of mitigation needed based on levels of COVID-19 community transmission and the capacities of the local public health and healthcare systems. (Re)Openingo In all Phases: o Establish and continue communication with State and local authorities to determine current mitigation levels in your community. o Consider assigning vulnerable workers duties that minimize their contact with customers and other employees (e.g., managing inventory rather than working as a cashier, managing administrative needs through telework). o Provide employees from higher transmission areas (earlier Phase areas) telework and other options as feasible to eliminate travel to workplaces in lower transmission (later Phase) areas and vice versa. o Phase 1: Bars remain closed and restaurant service should remain limited to drive-through, curbside take out, or delivery with strict social distancing.o Phase 2: Bars may open with limited capacity; restaurants may open dining rooms with limited seating capacity that allows for social distancing.o Phase 3: Bars may open with increased standing room occupancy that allows for social distancing; restaurants may operate while maintaining social distancing.Safety Actions Promote healthy hygiene practices (Phases 1-3) o Enforce hand washing, covering coughs and sneezes, and use of a cloth face covering by employees when near other employees and customers. o Ensure adequate supplies to support healthy hygiene practices for both employees and customers including soap, hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol (perhaps on every table, if supplies allow), and tissues. Post signs on how to stop the spread of COVID-19, properly wash hands, promote everyday protective measures, and properly wear a face covering. Intensify cleaning, disinfection and ventilation (Phases 1-3) o Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (for example, door handles, work stations, cash registers) at least daily and shared objects (for example, payment terminals, tables, countertops/bars, receipt trays, condiment holders) between use. Use products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2 and that are appropriate for the surface. Prior to wiping the surface, allow the disinfectant to sit for the necessary contact time recommended by the manufacturer. Train staff on proper cleaning procedures to ensure safe and correct application of disinfectants.o Make available individual disinfectant wipes in bathrooms, and post reminders not to flush these wipes but to dispose of them in the trash. o Wash, rinse, and sanitize food contact surfaces, food preparation surfaces, and beverage equipment after use. o Avoid using or sharing items such as menus, condiments, and any other food. Instead, use disposable or digital menus, single serving condiments, and no-touch trash cans and doors.o Use touchless payment options as much as possible, when available. Ask customers and employees to exchange cash or card payments by placing on a receipt tray or on the counter rather than by hand. Wipe any pens, counters, or hard surfaces between use or customer.o Use disposable food service items (utensils, dishes). If disposable items are not feasible, ensure that all non-disposable food service items are handled with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher. Employees should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after directly handling used food service itemso Use gloves when removing garbage bags or handling and disposing of trash and wash hands afterwards o Avoid using food and beverage implements brought in by customers. o Ensure that ventilation systems operate properly and increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible by opening windows and doors, using fans, other methods. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety risk to employees, children, or customers. Take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (for example, drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown to minimize the risk of Legionnaires’ disease and other diseases associated with water.Ensure social distancing Phase 1 o Limit service to drive-through, delivery, or curb-side pick-up options only. o Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and to ensure that customers remain at least six feet apart in lines or ask customers to wait in their cars or away from the establishment while waiting to pick up food.

  "content":"In talking to each other, we can help ourselves and each other, even at a distance.\nI am moved to action by the words of spiritual care provider Tom Craighead, a retired Episcopal Priest/Social Worker: I think of countless souls who simply need someone to be with and hear them. Facing an uncertain future or the threat of loss, many people instinctively want to talk. They may not know what they need. They might need to vent, to feel their anger, fear, or grief by speaking it. Talking helps them find their emotional footing. It often helps ground and calms them. Talking can also reconnect a person with themselves, with their life’s still-unfolding story. In this new challenge, they may begin to rediscover meaning, purpose, maybe even hope. In talking to each other, we can help ourselves and each other, even at a distance. The Community Care Team (CCT) is the voluntary counseling and behavioral health unit of the Vashon Public Health Medical Reserve Corps (MRC), which responds to medical and mental health needs during a disaster like the Covid-19 pandemic. Started in 2008, the care team provides resources for mental health needs, assessments and triage, individual and family support, and disaster-related emotional assistance. The care team collaborates with Vashon’s Medical Reserve Corps, agency providers and VashonBePrepared. Care team membership has grown since the start of the pandemic. The team branches support mental and spiritual health and include mental health counselors, social workers, nurse practitioners, psychologists, psychiatrists, priests, ministers, and other island professionals.We know firsthand the pandemic is causing anxiety, depression, and stress from feelings of isolation and uncertainty. Anyone can call the Vashon Community Care Team Help Line at (206) 701-0694 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. We are here for emotional, psychological, or spiritual support. Leave a message if we are unable to answer, we will return all calls. Our dedicated team offers:Confidential, no-cost counseling with trained and licensed mental health professionals. The mental health helpline offers up to three sessions. Confidential support from spiritual care providers. The spiritual helpline offers up to three sessions. Our spiritual care providers are island neighbors recognized for cultivating their own spirituality and compassionate listening and are not mental health experts. Free online support groups with experienced facilitators and/or spiritual care providers. Care team support groups presenting online Psychological First Aid to help residents and first responders. Resources at vashonbeprepared.org with mental health (local, state, and national), spiritual health with poems, prayers, and spiritual practices (with photos from island photographers). A postcard, mailed to all residents. Ayuda En Espanol (888) 628-9454 The Spiritual Resources Group (SRG) is a new arm of the Community Care Team. The group works with faith organizations, poets, and others to support the spiritual health of our community. Spiritual health is not limited to and does not assume belief or religion. Care providers respect and are guided by the perspectives, values, goals and experiences of the person seeking support. There will be no proselytizing or promoting of particular religious, spiritual, philosophical, moral, lifestyle, or other frameworks. SRG recognizes there are many spiritual communities on the island. Some are located in buildings. Others are less formal communities of belonging, meaning, care and celebration that may not consider themselves spiritual or religious, but do, in fact, feed the spirit.We on Vashon Island live in a beautiful and peaceful place surrounded by nature and the Puget Sound with a view of the mountains. It is an island paradise. That does not exclude us from the feelings of anxiety and uncertainty due to social distancing and isolation. Calls to practitioners in the Seattle area, including Vashon, have increased in recent weeks. People are starting to feel the effects of prolonged isolation and social distancing. They are worried about economic losses, both personally and nationally. Relationship issues have surfaced now that couples and families are in close proximity daily. We, as a country and community, have been through events together that challenged our foundations, our connections, our livelihoods. These have rocked our world, even here on the rock. The pandemic is a challenge that has touched almost all communities, and Vashon Island, so close to the epicenter, has been part of the earliest actions to control the spread of COVID-19. Connecting, practicing kindness, being active, helping, or asking for help — all help strengthen ourselves, our families, and our community. by Jinna Risdal, a therapist, educator, and administrator.

  "content":"From Public Health – Seattle \u0026amp; King County yesterday comes the following insight into our short term future with regards to social distancing.\nHow long will social distancing continue? •The modeling done by IHME at the University of Washington is somewhat reassuring, but the conclusions are not certain.•It doesn’t show what happens if people stop complying or are not as effective as they assume.​•Our success at distancing has limited the number of people that have been infected, and that also means most of us remain susceptible to the virus.•If we go back to business as usual, many people will be infected relatively quickly because COVID-19 remains circulating in the population.•We remain at risk for a large outbreak that would overwhelm the healthcare system.•That’s why the recent studies clearly state that we need to continue to stay strong with the Stay Home order for now.\nIt appears that they are waiting until there are near-zero deaths – late in May – before focusing on the following.Containment StrategiesWidespread testing, contact tracing, and isolation of new cases to minimize the risks of resurgence while maintaining social distancing measures like limiting the size of gatherings to reduce the risk of large-scale transmission.

  "content":"Vashon Island residents will have access to COVID-19 testing for residents whose medical care provider – on or off island - has referred them for a test. Testing will start April 7th from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. operating on weekdays as the availability of testing materials allows.The Vashon Covid-19 Testing Project will use a simplified procedure that minimizes exposure of patients and volunteer staff and the need for precious personal protective equipment. Vashon Island is particularly at risk because clinics and first responders have limited capacity, the island lacks an urgent care clinic or emergency room, and there are many high-risk residents. Testing focuses public health efforts on isolating and supporting infected individuals so they do not infect others. “Testing helps us identify who has the virus. Once we know who has the virus, we can contact others who have been exposed and test any of those with symptoms. The providers who make the referral are a critical part of this tracking. This is the fastest and most efficient way to stop the spread of COVID-19.”\n- Dr. Jim Bristow, retired pediatric cardiologist and former deputy director of the Joint Genome Institute at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab\nVashon Island residents to have COVID-19 Testing Project\u0026nbsp; Vashon Island will have a COVID-19 Testing Project for island residents referred by a care provider. Vashon Island’s volunteer Medical Reserve Corps (MRC), in collaboration with Vashon Island Fire and Rescue, and VashonBePrepared, will open the project site on April 7, 2020, from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and operate on weekdays as the availability of testing materials allows. Once the Vashon Covid-19 Testing team receives an order for the test from either an on or off-island care provider, a team member will contact the resident with instructions and directions. People arriving at the site without a referral will be turned away. Under existing Public Health guidelines, the team cannot provide a test without a care provider’s referral. Find details at https://testing.vashonbeprepared.org/. The self-test costs $50 and will be billed to patients’ insurance. No one will be denied a test if they are uninsured. If insurance claims are denied for any reason, the Testing Project will pay the cost. “Testing helps us identify who has the virus,” said Dr. James Bristow, retired pediatric cardiologist and former deputy director of the Joint Genome Institute at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. “Once we know who has the virus, we can contact others who have been exposed and test any of those with symptoms. The primary care providers who make referrals are a critical part of this tracking. This is the fastest and most efficient way to stop the spread of COVID-19.”\"We need to begin testing so we can tell who is capable of spreading the disease, isolate and support them, and find out who they may have passed the disease to. Even now with over 4,000 confirmed cases in Washington, fewer than 10 percent of people with symptoms who get tested for Covid-19 have the disease\"\n- Dr. Jim Bristow, retired pediatric cardiologist and former deputy director of the Joint Genome Institute at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab\nIf you do not live on Vashon Island and would like to be tested, contact your care provider for a test site near you. Limiting visits on or off island for testing helps prevent exposing yourself and others to the virus.\"We need to begin testing so we can tell who is capable of spreading the disease, isolate and support them, and find out who they may have passed the disease to,” said Dr. Bristow. “Remember, it’s also flu and allergy season. Even now with over 4,000 confirmed cases in Washington, fewer than 10 percent of tested people with symptoms that could be Covid-19 end up having the disease.”\"The number of cases in King County is doubling every six days. We can do better here on Vashon. The most important thing that Islanders can do is stay at home and absolutely minimize their contact with anyone outside their home.\"\n- Dr. Jim Bristow, retired pediatric cardiologist and former deputy director of the Joint Genome Institute at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab\nTesting is limited to symptomatic residents at risk for severe disease, first responders, those who provide essential services, and those people who have had contact with someone infected with COVID-19. Symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, cough and difficulty breathing. People with these symptoms, or exposed to someone who has Covid-19, should call their healthcare provider and discuss whether to get a test. If a Vashon resident does not have a healthcare provider, they may call Neighborcare Health at 206-548-5710 or Vashon Natural Medicine at 206-463-4778 to discuss their symptoms. Testing is available to all Vashon Island residents regardless of whether they receive their primary care on or off Vashon. \"The number of cases in King County is doubling every six days. We can do better here on Vashon. The most important thing that islanders can do is stay at home and absolutely minimize their contact with people outside their home,\" said Dr. Bristow.“Diagnosis is the first step to treatment. To diagnose COVID, you have to test for it. If we can identify who is infected, we can better help those infected while also protecting our island community and our off-island communities from viral spread.\"\n- Dr. John Osborn, ER physician, Seattle Veterans Administration Hospital and co-coordinator of the Vashon Medical Reserve Corps (MRC)\nThe COVID- 19 Testing Project’s strategy is to minimize the exposure of the volunteers and the community while conserving limited personal protective equipment for hospitals and clinics. Residents remain in their vehicle during the test. A volunteer will give them a self-test kit with instructions on how to administer the test and return the sample. Using the self-test, a resident will use a small swab to collect material from their nose. This self-collection process is simple and easier than the test seen in recent news. The test is similar to those used by the Seattle Flu Study and the SCAN project and was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after a study showed the test identifies over 90% of COVID-19 positive patients. \"Vashon's geographical isolation from the rest of King County may have bought us some time, but the clock is ticking\"\n- Dr. John Osborn, ER physician, Seattle Veterans Administration Hospital and co-coordinator of the Vashon Medical Reserve Corps (MRC)\n“Diagnosis is the first step to treatment. To diagnose COVID, you have to test for it. If we can identify who is infected, we can better help those infected while also protecting our island community and our off-island communities from viral spread,\" said Dr. John Osborn, ER physician, Seattle VA Veterans Administration hospital and co-coordinator of the Vashon Medical Reserve Corps (MRC).The COVID-19 Testing Project team will collect insurance information when scheduling the test and this will be sent with the sample to the diagnostic lab that will bill health insurers. By billing insurance, the Testing Project will conserve donated funds for those without insurance. \"Vashon's geographical isolation from the rest of King County may have bought us some time, but the clock is ticking,\" said Dr. John Osborn, ER physician, Seattle VA Veterans Administration Hospital and co-coordinator of the Vashon Medical Reserve Corps (MRC).RELEVANT LINKShttps://testing.vashonbeprepared.org/ https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/health/communicable-diseases/health-care-providers/advisories/2020/15-mar.aspxwww.vashonbeprepared.org/ www.vifr.org "},{

  "content":"\nSorry folks this was published last Saturday and only now is getting posted to this site. Next updates will happen on a timely basis!\nDate: March 21, 2020\nSUMMARY Vashon Island\u0026rsquo;s volunteer Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) has established the COVID Testing Steering Committee exploring options for testing island residents for COVID-19. Humans have no immunity and currently no medications are available. Vashon Island has no cases confirmed by Public Health \u0026ndash; Seattle and King County (PHSKC). Local physicians explore COVID testing for Vashon Island residents\nSTORY\nThe Vashon Island\u0026rsquo;s Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) has established a COVID Testing Steering Committee. The committee is exploring options for testing island residents for the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Humans have no immunity and currently no medications are available. Vashon Island currently has no cases confirmed by Public Health \u0026ndash; Seattle and King County (PHSKC), in contrast to the rest of King County.\n\"'Diagnosis is the first step to treatment,'\u0026rdquo; said Dr. John Osborn, an ER physician at the Seattle Veterans Administration hospital and co-coordinator of the Vashon Medical Reserve Corps (MRC). \"To diagnose COVID, you have to test for it. If we can identify who is infected, we can better help those infected while also protecting our island community and our off-island communities from viral spread.\"\nThe island\u0026rsquo;s COVID testing team includes Dr. Jim Bristow, retired pediatric cardiologist and former deputy director of the Joint Genome Institute at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab; Dr. Zach Miller, a retired Infectious Disease specialist; Dr. Ina Oppliger, a retired rheumatologist volunteering with Pierce County\u0026rsquo;s COVID program; and Dr. Bonny Olney, a family practice physician .\nWork on coordinating Vashon response to the Covid virus began in early March. Vashon\u0026rsquo;s volunteer run Emergency Operations Center has been supporting the COVID testing team efforts. Shawn Boesler, Logistics Section Chief is investigating resources needed to prepare for on-island testing. The COVID testing team, Vashon Emergency Operations Center and VashonBePrepared volunteers have been coordinating island assets, volunteers and services.\n\"Vashon Island still has time, but the clock is ticking,\" Dr. Osborn added. \"We must move quickly, and we need to get this right if we are going to avoid what is happening in other parts of King County.\"\nThe COVID testing team meets daily. Members are actively reaching out to labs, active COVID testing projects and programs, and to their personal contacts in the medical and science community in Puget Sound and nationwide. Even as the infection and mortality numbers climb, testing options and availability are changing daily. If on-island testing moves forward, scarcity of testing kits, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as N95 facemasks and trained personnel are issues. The COVID testing team is exploring options that would require less PPE but those options must adhere to professional medical standards.\n\u0026ldquo;From Wuhan and Italy we know this is a life or death situation,\u0026rdquo; Osborn said. \u0026ldquo;In the meantime, we ask that island residents - all of you \u0026ndash; strictly adhere to public health recommendations including social distancing and hygiene. Public health measures are our one and only weapon in this war with the virus. Right now, we are losing that war and we must turn the tide. This is something all of us can do to protect our friends and family.\u0026rdquo;\nHealth care professionals including clinicians, nurses, social workers, counselors, and psychologists are encouraged to volunteer with the Vashon Medical Reserve Corps during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Every one should read this!\nClick here to download “CDC’s Recommendations for the next 30 days of Mitigation Strategies for Seattle-King, Pierce and Snohomish Counties based on current situation with widespread COVID-19 transmission and affected health care facilities”\nBottom Line Up Front\n\u0026nbsp; Due to widespread transmission in Seattle, Washington, CDC recommends extensive community mitigation activities to support slowing the spread of respiratory virus infections. These approaches are used to minimize morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19 and minimize social and economic impacts of COVID-19. Individuals, communities, businesses, and healthcare organizations are all part of a community mitigation strategy. Given the widespread community transmission in Seattle, WA, and the extensive involvement of health care facilities, especially nursing facilities at the epicenter, substantial interventions for both community (Table) and health care settings (appendix A) should be implemented at this time, based on the urgency of protecting the health care system with expected rise in cases by slowing the spread within the community.\nImplementation emphasizes:\n• Emphasizing individual responsibility for implementation of recommended personal-level actions,\n• Empowering businesses, schools, and community organizations to implement recommended actions, particularly in ways that protect persons at risk of severe illness such as older adults and persons with\n2\nserious underlying health conditions (e.g., people requiring dialysis , or those with congestive heart failure or emphysema)\n• Focusing on settings that provide critical services to implement recommended actions to protect critical infrastructure and individuals at risk of severe disease\n• Minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible\n"},{

  "content":"March 5, 2020SummaryPublic Health has specific advice for people who have been confirmed with COVID-19, have been around someone with COVID-19, or are feeling unwell but haven’t been in close contact with someone with COVID-19. With respect to testing, Public Health – Seattle \u0026amp; King County does not typically conduct testing. Testing is typically conducted by taking a swab at a health care provider’s office.StoryIn King County, we currently have reported 51 confirmed cases of COVID-19. We are likely to see many more cases of COVID-19 in the coming days and weeks. Symptoms of COVID-19 typically include fever, cough or shortness of breath. Here is guidance on what to do:What to do if you have confirmed or suspected COVID-19Restrict activities outside your home, except for getting medical care. Separate yourself from other people and animals in your home. Do not go to work, school or public areas. Avoid using public transportation, taxis, or ride-share. Monitor your symptoms and call before visiting your doctor. If you have an appointment, be sure you tell them you have or may have COVID-19. If you have one, wear a facemask around other people, such as sharing a room or vehicle, or around pets and before entering a healthcare provider's office. If you can't wear a mask because it's hard for you to breathe while wearing one, then keep people who live with you out of your room, or have them wear a facemask if they come in your room. Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throw away in a lined trashcan. Wash hands thoroughly afterwards. Soap and water is best. Avoid sharing personal household items like dishes and glasses, or bedding. Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. If you can't wash your hands, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Rub hands together until dry. Clean all \"high touch\" surfaces every day, such as counters, tables, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, phones, and keyboards. Use a household cleaning product to clean, following the manufacturer's recommendations. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1. Notify dispatch that you have or may have COVID-19 Remain in home isolation for 7 days OR until 72 hours after your fever has resolved (and symptoms get better) whichever is longer.What to do if you were potentially exposed to someone with confirmed COVID-19First, know that you generally need to be in close contact with someone with COVID-19 to get infected. Close contact includes scenarios like living with or caring for a person with confirmed COVID-19, being within six feet of a person with confirmed COVID-19 for about 10 minutes, or if someone with COVID-19 coughed on you, kissed you, shared utensils with you or you had direct contact with their body secretions.If you may have had close contact with a person with COVID-19 but are not sickMonitor your health for fever, cough and shortness of breath for 14 days after your last contact with the ill person. Do not go to school or work. Avoid public places for 14 days.If you are a close contact of a person with confirmed COVID-19 and are sickIf you are sick with fever, cough, or shortness of breath, even if your symptoms are mild, isolate yourself. If you are at higher risk for severe illness (over 60, with underlying health conditions such as heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes), have a weakened immune system or are pregnant) call your health care provider. They may want to test you for COVID-19. If you have symptoms but are not in a high risk category, talk with your health care provider. They will help you determine if you need to be evaluated.What to do if you have COVID-19 symptoms but haven't been around anyone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. These can be symptoms of other respiratory illnesses as well as COVID-19. If you are in a high-risk category, and have symptoms of COVID-19, call your healthcare provider for advice. If you are at risk for serious illness, your healthcare provider may arrange a test for COVID-19. If you do not have a high risk condition and your symptoms are mild, you do not need to be tested for COVID-19. Do not go out when you are sick, practice excellent hygiene, and wear a facemask when you are around other people if you can. Cover coughs and sneezes. Avoid sharing personal household items. Clean your hands often. Clean all \"high-touch\" surfaces like doorknobs often. Monitor your symptoms and call your health care provider if symptoms worsen. Stay home and avoid others for 72 hours after your fever goes down and symptoms get better.For more detailed information or to print these recommendations and share them with others click on the following links:What to do if you have confirmed or suspected COVID-19What to do if you were potentially exposed to someone with confirmed COVID-19What to do if you have symptoms of COVID-19 and have not been around anyone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19About testingCurrently, the capacity for testing in Washington state is inadequate for the number of people who want to be tested. Therefore, only people at highest risk for serious illness are likely to be tested currently. That should change as soon as soon as tomorrow as the public health system and private laboratories increase testing capacity.Public Health – Seattle \u0026amp; King County does not typically conduct testing. Testing is typically conducted by taking a swab at a health care provider's office.All King County residents should follow this advice:Do not go to the emergency room unless essential. Emergency rooms need to be able to serve those with the most critical needs. If you have symptoms like cough, fever, or other respiratory problems, contact your regular doctor first.Stay home when sick.Practice excellent personal hygiene habits, including handwashing, coughing into tissue or elbow, avoid touching eyes, nose, or mouth.Stay away from people who are ill, especially if you are 60 and older or have underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, or a weakened immune system, or if you are pregnant.Stay informed. Information is changing frequently. Check and subscribe to Public Health's website (www.kingcounty.gov/COVID) or blog (www.publichealthinsider.com).Remember to take every day preventive action such as washing hands, and if you are sick stay home. During an outbreak with a new virus there is a lot of uncertainty. Our guidance and advice is subject to change as we learn more. We will continue to keep you updated. "},{

  "content":"4 March 2020SummaryLocal health officials announced new guidance to King County residents aimed at reducing their risk of exposure to COVID-19. While all residents can take steps now, people with underlying health conditions are urged to follow recommendations to avoid large gatherings of people.StoryLocal health officials announced today new recommendations to King County residents aimed at reducing their risk of exposure to COVID-19. We understand these actions will have a tremendous impact on the lives of people in our community. We are making these recommendations in consultation with CDC based on the best information we have currently to protect the public's health.This is a critical moment in the growing outbreak of COVID-19 in King County and these measures can potentially impact the spread of the disease.Public Health is recommending, but not requiring, the following steps:People at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible, including public places with lots of people and large gatherings where there will be close contact with others. People at higher risk include: People 60 and older People with underlying health conditions including heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes People who have weakened immune systems People who are pregnantWorkplaces should enact measures that allow people who can work from home to do so. Taking these measures can help reduce the number of workers who come into contact with COVID-19 and help minimize absenteeism due to illness If you can feasibly avoid bringing large groups of people together, consider postponing events and gatherings. Public Health is not recommending closing schools at this time unless there has been a confirmed case in the school. Public Health – Seattle \u0026amp; King County also respects an individual school's decisions about closures or postponement of activities as each school knows the needs of their community best. All people should not go out when they are sick. Avoid visiting hospitals, long term care facilities, or nursing homes to the extent possible. If you need to go, limit your time there and keep six feet away from patients.More detail on these measures will be available at www.kingcounty.gov/covidCase update:COVID-19 test results have come back from the Washington State Public Health Laboratory confirming ten additional cases of COVID-19 in King County residents including one death.

If you have symptoms like cough, fever, or other respiratory problems, contact your regular doctor first.Stay home when sick.Practice excellent personal hygiene habits, including handwashing, coughing into tissue or elbow, avoid touching eyes, nose, or mouth.Stay away from people who are ill, especially if you are 60 and older or have underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, or a weakened immune system.Stay informed. Information is changing frequently. Check and subscribe to Public Health's website (www.kingcounty.gov/COVID) or blog (www.publichealthinsider.com).Remember to take every day preventive action such as watching hands, and if you are sick stay home. During an outbreak with a new virus there is a lot of uncertainty. Our guidance and advice is subject to change as we learn more. We will continue to keep you updated. "},{

  "content":"A major new report has just been issued by the UW Climate Impacts Group. For the first time it gives detailed predictions for sea level rise that is mapped throughout Washington’s coast line, including Puget Sound.\nVashon is covered by 6 overlapping study regions, as shown in the map to the right. Click on the map (may only work for some browsers, like Chrome) and then click on one of the circles representing the area you are interested in. A Google docs spreadsheet should open up providing probabilities of sea level rise decade by decade for that selected area. Note the spreadsheet has 3 tabs on the bottom.\n“The new report provides probabilistic estimates for 171 coastal sites each decade from now until 2150. The analysis follows two previous assessments of sea-level rise in the state: the 2012 national report for sea-level rise in Washington, Oregon and California, and a 2008 report led by the UW Climate Impacts Group. In addition to updating the science, the new report offers more detail on what to expect at specific locations.\n“The study follows a 2015 UW report on how climate change will affect Puget Sound. This new study provides much greater detail about sea-level rise, both in Puget Sound and along the coast.\n“Previous assessments were zoomed out, and were not fine-scale enough to capture the variations in land movement along the coastlines,” said second author Harriet Morgan, a research consultant with the UW Climate Impacts Group. “Neah Bay is rising, and south Puget Sound is sinking. That up and down movement has a pretty big influence on how far the ocean will be able to travel inland.”\n- www.washington.edu/news/2018/07/30/sea-level-rise-report-contains-best-projections-yet-for-washingtons-coasts/\nThe actual report is at:\nhttp://www.wacoastalnetwork.com/wcrp-documents.html\nand articles about it are at:\nhttp://www.washington.edu/news/2018/07/30/sea-level-rise-report-contains-best-projections-yet-for-washingtons-coasts/\nhttps://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/matt-driscoll/article215767485.html\nhttps://komonews.com/news/local/sea-level-could-rise-up-to-3-feet-in-seattle-study-says\n"},{

  "content":"Over a decade ago, about 75 enthusiastic CERT volunteers came out to the Evergreen State Fairgrounds in Monroe, Snohomish County, for the day. That memorable day, in 2003, was the first CERT Expo. The CERT Expo evolved to include continuing education sessions in the morning and participation by volunteers in a disaster exercise in the afternoon.\u0026#160; In 2005, the CERT Expo expanded and moved to the Everett Community College. Our intrepid volunteers spread the word about the Expo and, in 2007, the Expo moved to the Washington State Fire Training Academy, in North Bend, to accommodate the growing participation of CERT volunteers from across the state. Children’s Hospital and the State Citizen Corps joined us as partners, which allowed us to extend our offerings. The focus was on skill refreshers through training and disaster exercises. Since 2008, the Expo has expanded to include Citizen Corps partners and affiliates from across the Northwest: including participants from Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Canada.\u0026#160; Each year, with the help of our sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff, we train hundreds of disaster response volunteers on key emergency response skills, preparing them to assist when the need arises in their own communities. By 2010, over 200 people were actively training and participating in the Expo. The need for emergency preparedness has been front and center in the news with the SR-530 mudslide, wildfires and flooding and the threat of tsunamis and a Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake. Changing weather patterns increase the risk for extreme weather events and, no matter where we live, natural disasters can strike at any time. True to the calling to community service, our numbers continue to grow.

(ACS is broader than just ham radio and works on all forms of communication.) ACS consists of licensed amateurs who voluntarily register their qualifications and equipment for public communications duty when disaster strikes. Internet, traditional and cell phones, email and other forms of modern communications are periodically disrupted – and often during emergencies. Amateur Radio provides the only consistent, decentralized and resilient communications backup for communities.\nACS Lead, Michael Meyer says, “Vashon ACS has exercised a wide variety of communication emergency scenarios, and found that a combination of voice radio and email-over-radio (without the internet) provides a robust, Island-wide and off-Island communications network.\u0026#160; ACS can quickly staff radio caches at the four Island outlying fire stations and the EOC Radio Room at Station 55.\u0026#160; Our frequent drills with Vashon Island Fire \u0026amp; Rescue, CERT, MRC and VashonBePrepared has really improved our effectiveness and ability to efficiently respond to actual incidents. Communications help keep crises from becoming disasters.”\n2018 Field Day\nOn Saturday and Sunday June 23rd and 24th, VMIRC competes in ARRL’s Field Day event (http://www.arrl.org/field-day and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_Day_%28amateur_radio%29) with thousands of amateur radio operators making radio contacts from community parks, campgrounds, schools and emergency centers throughout North America. Open to families and the general public, this free event is a great way for those curious about radio communications to see real operations, chat with operators and even try a call themselves. Field Day is a good day to acquaint yourself with the workings of the W7VMI trailer, radios and antenna's, all in a no-stress environment with lots of \u0026quot;elmering\u0026quot;. Of course there will also be classes on digital radio and lots of time to rag chew as well.\nVMIRC champion Sharon Danielson says, “Everyone is invited to come and see what ham radio is all about.\u0026#160; There is something for everyone of any age, most of all friendship and camaraderie!”\nPoints are awarded for a wide variety of activities under simulated emergency conditions: ·\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; encouraging alternative \u0026amp; emergency power sources such as batteries and solar arrays, ·\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; mobile operation of radios and antennas, ·\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; operation of a wide range of modes (e.g., voice, historical Morse code, digital email and video sent via radio), ·\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; continuous 24 hour availability, ·\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; ability to reach other contestants across the globe, ·\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; visits by elected officials, and ·\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; involvement of youth and the public who have never tried radio operation before.\nThis year we are going to try something different.\u0026#160;\u0026#160; We will set up in a large field next to the Swallows Nest on Maury Island, with a beautiful view of Puget Sound and Mount Rainier.\u0026#160; We are also going to set up three radio stations, two for voice and/or CW and a third for digital modes.\u0026#160; We will have the usual Pot Luck Dinner starting at 17:30 on Saturday followed by a class on using hand held radios for email and fox hunting courtesy of Michael KB7MTM.\nFor those of you who haven’t been to Field Day before, the data exchange with contacts across the country means we are a three station club operation located in Western Washington operating with the call sign W7VMI.\u0026#160; Two stations will be in the club trailer, and Sharon AE7SD has graciously agreed to bring a sparkling clean horse trailer for the third station.\nSetup will begin at 9:00 Saturday morning and takedown generally happens late Sunday morning. You are welcome to attend any time during that timeframe, but the prime opportunity to meet everyone and learn how Vashon will preserve communications after a disaster will be Saturday afternoon.\nEveryone is welcome to operate one of the stations, and there will be plenty of help around to assist if you have never operated one of the club HF radios or have never operated long distance on the radio or in a contest.\u0026#160; Also, family members and friends who are not licensed ham operators can get in on the fun too by operating the radios as a guest under the guidance of one of our licensed club members, and we get additional points for the club when someone under 18 makes a contact!\nFor the hidden transmitter hunt (called a \u0026quot;fox hunt\u0026quot;), you hide a low-wattage transmitter in the woods somewhere and then use a home-made directional antenna to triangulate and find the transmitter.\u0026#160; Sort of \u0026quot;radio orienteering.\u0026quot;\u0026#160; For big fox hunts they hide five transmitters and race to see who can find them all first.\u0026#160; I guess folks actually run with their antennas and radios!\nVMIRC President Craig Gagner reports, “The public is invited to see what ham radio is all about and have a chance to try their hand at making radio contacts and experience the fun of operating an amateur radio station.\u0026#160; This is a chance to meet and talk with Vashon’s radio operators and see what modern Emergency Communications is all about.\u0026#160; During the two day event we will have demonstrations of satellite communications, a digital communications workshop and an opportunity to learn how to get your own FCC radio license before the next disaster strikes. We’ll also be using the club’s new second transmitter. It provides exciting new digital modes and technical capabilities to the community.”\nSchedule\nSaturday 6/23/18\n· 0800: Breakfast: Sporties\n· 0900-11:00 a.m.: (aka 1800 UTC) Proceed to the field just south of the Swallows Nest on Maury Island, behind the setup antenna's, open trailer, test radios, drink coffees, get in each other’s way\n· 11:00 a.m-23:59: Play radio on HF voice, CW and Digital, drink coffee, soda, water etc.\n· 17:30: Potluck, bring your own plates and cups and something to share.\n· 18:30-19:30 After dinner classes: digital modes and why you should love them.\nSunday 6/24/18\n· 00:01-11:00 Play radio on HF voice, CW and Digital, drink coffee, soda, water etc., rub eyes, stumble around in the dark\n· 0900: Coffee at 9:00, are YOU bringing pastries?\n· Breakdown:11:00-12:00, return trailer to EOC\nFor more information about preparedness and amateur radio – please visit:\n· Vashon Maury Island Radio Club:\u0026#160; www.vmirc.org\n· VashonBePrepared: www.VashonBePrepared.org\n· Vashon Island Fire \u0026amp; Rescue: www.vifr.org\n· King County Office of Emergency Management: www.kingcounty.gov/safety/prepare.aspx\n· ARRL the national association for Amateur Radio:\u0026#160; www.arrl.org/field-day\n"},{

  "content":"Hello 2018! The new year promises some great opportunities in emergency preparedness and response education, exercises, and collaborations. One very important area of emphasis is communications. If your NERO group doesn\u0026rsquo;t already include a few folks with a ham radio license and equipment, it would be great to consider adding that to the list of your neighborhood\u0026rsquo;s skills and resources!\nHam radio is a lot easier and more affordable these days, since Morse code is no longer required, and a starting cost for a handheld ham radio is now below $30. (see link below)\nUnfortunately there won\u0026rsquo;t be any classes offered here on Vashon soon, but the West Seattle Amateur Radio Club (the team that does the excellent training and testing here when we do have it) are hosting classes at the end of January for both technician and general licenses.\nSee the brochure for ham radio classes in West Seattle (PDF), and look below for links to more handy ham radio resources.\nAs always, if you would like help (re)organizing your NERO group, please give me a call or send an email. nero@vashonbeprepared.org or 650/273-2I40\nMore resources:\nhttp://westseattleblog.com/2017/12/new-year-new-skill-west-seattle-amateur-radio-club-offering-2018-ham-classes/\nLearn more about West Seattle Amateur Radio Club (WSARC):\nhttp://www.westseattlearc.org/\nConnect with Vashon Maury Island Radio Club (VMIRC) for info about getting the right equipment and learning how to use your ham radio:\nhttp://vashonbeprepared.org/Partners/VMIRC\nhttp://w7vmi.org/doku/doku.php\nEquipment to get started costs under $30!\nhttps://www.amazon.com/BaoFeng-UV-5R-Dual-Radio-Black/dp/B007H4VT7A\nConsider also taking the Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) course if you haven\u0026rsquo;t yet. It\u0026rsquo;s free of charge, covers a wide range of practice preparedness and response topics, and begins on March 31, 2018.

  "content":"SEATTLE – A year following one of the nation’s largest domestic drills, lessons-learned continue to guide strategies that improve the Pacific Northwest’s ability to survive and recover from a catastrophic Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) earthquake and tsunami.\nOn June 7, 2016, more than 20,000 emergency managers in Idaho, Oregon and Washington kicked off Cascadia Rising 2016, a four-day, large scale exercise to test response and recovery capabilities in the wake of a 9.0 magnitude CSZ earthquake and tsunami. The exercise involved local, state, tribal and federal partners, along with military commands, private sector and non-governmental organizations.\nLessons learned from Cascadia Rising 2016\n\u0026quot;I'm pleased the momentum from Cascadia Rising continues to gain speed,\u0026quot; said Maj. Gen. Bret Daugherty, director of the Washington Military Department and commander of the Washington National Guard. \u0026quot;As a result of the exercise, our governor directed the formation of a Resilient Washington sub-cabinet, a multi-agency workgroup charged with improving our state's resiliency. Cascadia Rising also guided our decision to change our recommendation on preparedness, so we're now telling people to have enough emergency supplies to stay on their own for up to two weeks.\u0026quot;\n“Cascadia Rising was the largest exercise the State of Oregon has ever conducted. The complexity of the four-day exercise provided an unprecedented opportunity to examine and assess response and emergency management practices, and identify areas where we excel and where we can improve,” said Oregon Office of Emergency Management Director Andrew Phelps. “The collaboration among all levels of government, and with our private sector partners leading up to and during the exercise, was outstanding. I believe these relationships were strengthened through this experience and will continue to grow as we work toward enhancing our preparedness posture.”\n“In addition, Cascadia Rising served as a reminder to all Oregonians that individual and family emergency preparedness is key to an effective response to an earthquake or any disaster and begin the recovery process,” said Phelps. “As we constantly improve our capabilities, we ask all to be prepared for at least two weeks.”\nIdaho’s participation helped raise awareness that the residual effects of an earthquake and tsunami along the coast would be felt in Idaho. That includes the possible need to accommodate tens of thousands of evacuees and displaced persons who were directly impacted.\n“The countless strong partnerships we cultivated in the years leading up to the exercise proved invaluable to the success of Cascadia Rising in Idaho,” said Gen Brad Richy, of the Idaho Office of Emergency Management. “The collaboration with FEMA Region 10, and our Idaho counties, is proving indispensable as Idaho currently manages one of the most challenging flood seasons on record. Thirty-one of Idaho’s 44 counties have disaster declarations in place right now. When people ask about the importance of exercises, I like to point out that lessons learned during Cascadia Rising 2016 have improved our swift and effective response to the 2017 flooding disasters.”\n“The Cascadia Rising 2016 exercise highlighted a number of critical areas that we, the emergency management community, should improve before this fault ruptures, which will impact large portions of our residents and infrastructure. It is exercises like this, that foster coordination and help build relationships before a real-world event occurs,” said Sharon Loper, Acting FEMA Region 10 Administrator. “The exercise highlighted a number of infrastructure interdependencies our residents have come to rely on, such as electricity, communications, fuel, water and our roads.\u0026#160; Most of these sectors would be heavily disrupted after a CSZ event and plans are being developed and exercised that focus on the efficient recovery of these essential services.\u0026#160; In this past year, FEMA Region 10 has made improvements in coordinating disaster logistics, family reunification strategies and mass power outage scenarios with our partners.” “Every exercise teaches us something and improves our response,” said Loper. “I’m pleased so many partners and community members collaborate on these important issues. We should continue to work together so that we are all better prepared to protect lives and property.” Background\nLying mostly offshore, the plate interface that is the Cascadia Subduction Zone is a giant fault approximately 700 miles long. At this location, the set of tectonic plates to the west is sliding (subducting) beneath the North American plate. Friction prevents movement of these two plates; ultimately, these plates are stuck. The stress of these boundaries is continuously building until the fault suddenly breaks, resulting in a potentially devastating 700-mile earthquake and ensuing tsunami along the California, Oregon and Washington coastlines. Last year’s Cascadia Rising 2016 exercise was to test plans and procedures through a 9.0M earthquake and follow-on tsunami with expectations to improve catastrophic disaster operational readiness across the whole community.\nThe Cascadia Subduction Zone off the coast of North America spans from northern California to southern British Columbia. This subduction zone can produce earthquakes as large as magnitude 9 and corresponding tsunamis. Download Original\n###\nCascadia Rising 2016 was a four-day exercise focused on interagency and multi-state coordination following a 9.0M Cascadia Subductions Zone earthquake and follow-on tsunami. Emergency management centers at local, state, tribal and federal levels in coordination with military commands, private sector and non-governmental organizations in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, activated to coordinate simulated field response operations.\nRelated Links: Cascadia Rising 2016\n"},{

For that reason, the Budget also proposes establishing a 25 percent non-Federal cost match for FEMA preparedness grant awards that currently require no cost match. This is the same cost-sharing approach as FEMA’s disaster recovery grants.

  "content":"A number of devastating earthquakes and powerful storms made 2016 the costliest twelve months for natural catastrophe losses in the last four years. Losses totaled US$ 175bn, a good two-thirds more than in the previous year, and very nearly as high as the figure for 2012 (US$ 180bn). The share of uninsured losses – the so-called protection or insurance gap – remained substantial at around 70%. Almost 30% of the losses, some US$ 50bn, were insured.\nKey natural catastrophe figures of 2016:\nBoth overall losses and insured losses were above the inflation-adjusted average for the past ten years (US$ 154bn and 45.1bn respectively). Taking very small events out of the equation, 750 relevant loss events such as earthquakes, storms, floods, droughts and heatwaves were recorded in the Munich Re NatCatSERVICE database. That is significantly above the ten-year average of 590. Some 8,700 lives were sadly lost as a result of these natural catastrophes, far fewer at least than in 2015 (25,400), yet within the ten-year average (60,600). The past year was thus the year with the fewest fatalities (after 2014, with 8,050 fatalities) in 30 years (1986: 8,600). The high number of flood events, including river flooding and flash floods, was exceptional and accounted for 34% of overall losses, compared with an average of 21% over the past ten years. \u0026#160;\nThe five costliest natural catastrophes of the year\nEarthquake in Japan most expensive natural catastrophe of 2016 The costliest natural catastrophes of the year occurred in Asia. There were two earthquakes on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu close to the city of Kumamoto in April (overall losses US$ 31bn; proportion of insured losses just under 20%), and devastating floods in China in June and July (overall losses US$ 20bn; only some 2% of which were insured). North America was hit by more loss occurrences in 2016 than in any other year since 1980, with 160 events recorded. The year’s most serious event here was Hurricane Matthew. Its greatest impact was in the Caribbean island nation of Haiti, which was still struggling to recover from the 2010 earthquake. Matthew killed around 550 people in Haiti, and also caused serious damage on the east coast of the USA. Overall losses totaled US$ 10.2bn, with over a third of this figure insured. Series of storms in Europe, wildfires in Canada North America was also impacted by other extreme weather hazards, including wildfires in the Canadian town of Fort McMurray in May, and major floods in the southern US states in summer. In Canada, the mild winter with less snow than usual, and the spring heatwaves and droughts which followed, were the principal causes of the devastating wildfires that hit the oil-sand-producing region of Alberta, generating overall losses of US$ 4bn. More than two-thirds of this figure was insured. In August, floods in Louisiana and other US states following persistent rain triggered losses totaling US$ 10bn, around a quarter of which was insured.\nThere was a series of storms in Europe in late May and early June. Torrential rain triggered numerous flash floods, particularly in Germany, and there was major flooding on the River Seine in and around Paris. Overall losses totaled some US$ 6bn (approximately €5.4bn), around half of which was insured. “After three years of relatively low natural catastrophe losses, the figures for 2016 are back in the mid-range, where they are expected to be. Losses in a single year are obviously random and cannot be seen as a trend”, said member of the Board of Management Torsten Jeworrek. “The high percentage of uninsured losses, especially in emerging markets and developing countries, remains a concern. Greater insurance density is important, as it helps to alleviate the financial consequences of a catastrophe for more people. With its risk knowledge, the insurance industry would in fact be able to bear a much greater portion of such unpredictable risks.”\n“A look at the weather-related catastrophes of 2016 shows the potential effects of unchecked climate change. Of course, individual events themselves can never be attributed directly to climate change. But there are now many indications that certain events – such as persistent weather systems or storms bringing torrential rain and hail – are more likely to occur in certain regions as a result of climate change”, explained Peter Höppe, Head of Munich Re’s Geo Risks Research Unit\n- www.munichre.com/en/media-relations/publications/press-releases/2017/2017-01-04-press-release/index.html\n"},{

  "content":"OLYMPIA – Gov. Jay Inslee today issued a directive to state agencies to bolster Washington state efforts to prepare for a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami.\nThe directive establishes a new Resilient Washington subcabinet charged with providing a coordinated approach to preparing for and responding to a major earthquake or tsunami. The subcabinet’s efforts will address everything from educating the public about personal preparedness to planning for major disruptions to utility and fuel services and destruction of major roads, bridges and airports. The subcabinet will also develop recommendations and plans for ensuring availability of medical and human service operations. “We know the question isn’t ‘if’ a large-scale earthquake will happen in our state, but how well we will be prepared,” Inslee said. “While there’s no way to fully anticipate all the impacts a large-scale earthquake will have on our infrastructure, we know that preparedness starts in every household and every community, and the response depends on cooperation and collaboration at all levels of government. This effort is about each of us building resilience and being ready.” Washington is situated on the Cascadia subduction zone, known as one of the largest and most dangerous fault lines in the world. Experts predict the region is likely to experience a major earthquake and tsunami that will cause significant damage along the West Coast, including California, Oregon, Washington and parts of Vancouver Island. This summer, Washington, Oregon and British Columbia participated in the unprecedented simulation exercise Cascadia Rising. Nearly 23,000 officials and representatives from federal, military, tribal, state and local governments and nongovernmental organizations participated to train and test their response to a simulated 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami. Maj. Gen. Bret Daugherty of the Washington State Military Department said the exercise helped identify where good collaboration and preparedness are already in place and where improvements are needed. He said Inslee’s directive is a crucial next step in strategically identifying how best to address gaps in the system and ensure continuing collaboration among community and government leaders.\n“We learned a lot from Cascadia Rising, which is exactly why we conducted the exercise. Now the hard work really begins,” Daugherty said. “I appreciate the governor’s commitment to creating a safer and more prepared state. And I look forward to working with our Resilient Washington subcabinet partners to address those areas where there’s room to improve and to develop new strategies that help protect our citizens and communities.”\nThe subcabinet will rely heavily on the expertise of the Washington State Seismic Safety Commission, which published the 2012 report Resilient Washington State. The report provides a framework for long-term implementation of seismic risk reduction policies and activities across Washington with the goal of making the state resilient within a 50-year time frame.\u0026#160; The subcabinet’s first meeting will take place in January. Initial recommendations are due to the governor June 30, 2017.\n"},{

  "content":"The Seattle Times took a look at the Cascadia Rising final draft report: we failed.\nNot so much Vashon, but the state. The article is at:\nhttp://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/washington-states-plan-for-megaquake-grossly-inadequate-review-finds/\nThe draft report is at:\nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3152696-CR16-State-AAR-Final-Draft-Oct-21-2016.html\nExecutive Summary Overarching Conclusions A large magnitude Cascadia Subduction Zone fault earthquake and tsunami is perhaps one of the most complex disaster scenarios we face as emergency management and public safety officials in the Pacific Northwest. Due to this complexity, life-saving and life-sustaining response operations will hinge on the effective coordination and integration of governments at all levels – cities, counties, state agencies, federal departments, the military, and tribal nations – as well as non-governmental organizations and the private sector. It is this joint-operational whole community approach that we worked to enhance and test during the Cascading Rising exercise.\nIn broad context, Cascadia Rising was not merely a week long exercise held in the second week of June 2016, but a two-year event with many building-block events that contributed to the whole community’s (local-state-tribal-federal) analysis, planning, and assumptions about catastrophic preparedness.\nThrough the two-year ramp-up and the culminating functional and full scale exercises, the following overarching conclusions can be drawn:\nThere is an urgent need for residents to prepare Despite the ongoing public education efforts and community preparedness programs, our families, communities, schools, hospitals, and businesses are not prepared for the catastrophic disaster that a worst-case CSZ earthquake would cause.\nThere is an urgent need for state and local government – agencies, emergency management, leadership – to complete comprehensive and coordinated response plans The professional responders – fire services, law enforcement, public works, public health, and emergency management organizations – among others, have not sufficiently planned and rehearsed for a catastrophic event where they themselves are in the impact zone.\nCatastrophic response is fundamentally different than any response we have seen before In the CSZ scenario, response infrastructure is damaged. The people, equipment, facilities, power, bulk fuels, and other material resources that would normally be called upon to respond to a typical disaster such as wildfire, winter storms, or flooding will be in the impact-zone which will cover half the states of Washington and Oregon and areas of British Columbia. A “Push” response is required. The typical response to incidents and disasters begins at the local level – dispatch, fire, law enforcement, public works, etc. Once the local level and mutual aid is overwhelmed, requests for support are elevated to the county, then state, and if required to the federal level. This is commonly referred to as a “pull” system, here the highest level of government pulls up only requests for support in order to respond. Cascadia Rising proved this approach is grossly inadequate in response to a CSZ earthquake due to the wide spread damage, sense of urgency, and barriers to normal communication and coordination. Prior to the exercise, state, federal, and military logistical planners identified a “pull” approach would likely be inadequate and adjusted procedures to coordinate a more proactive approach. The exercise reinforced the need for planners at the federal and state levels to develop procedures that facilitate effective “push” operations under appropriate circumstances, manage aid deployment, and establish related accountability standards. A massive response will be required. The scale of damage to critical infrastructure that would be caused by a full rip of the entire fault line would be massive and affect millions of people from the coast through the I-5 corridor to the Cascades from British Columbia to Northern California. While the principal goal of initial response is to sustain the maximum number of survivors until a robust transportation capability is restored, the clock is ticking to a humanitarian disaster. Because of the severe damage to the power grid, transportation networks, and drinking water facilities, the first order damage from intense shaking, liquefaction, landslides, and large tsunami will lead to second and third order problems of food and water shortages, sanitation issues, heating issues, and other public health and healthcare related issues. Way Ahead  Publish and present the After Action Report to the Emergency Management Council.  Brief the Governor’s Office.  Implement Resilient WA subcabinet.  Continue to develop the state catastrophic plan with a focus on detailed concepts and appropriate ESF engagement.  Public Outreach and messaging.

  "content":"Download a PDF version of this brochure (with better layout!) by clicking here.\nVashon Island Fire \u0026amp; Rescue Welcomes National Guard A Note from Fire Chief Hank Lipe Nobody could ever truly be ready for an earthquake as bad as the Cascadia scenario. It will overwhelm even the best efforts of our small fire district and the many organizations and volunteers in the VashonBePrepared coalition.\nBut Islanders are resilient and I know we will all work together as neighbors to take care of each other as best we can until mainland help arrives. Still, a community\u0026rsquo;s response to a large scale disaster is only as good as its planning and training. That\u0026rsquo;s why VIFR has put so many resources into this exercise.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s also why I\u0026rsquo;m pleased to welcome the Washington National Guard to Vashon for exercise week. All across the country, the National Guard provides humanitarian relief, responding to floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, landslides and earthquakes. They have made this earthquake exercise the main focus for their annual summer training. So, we\u0026rsquo;re fortunate to have the 181st Brigade Support Battalion with us. They\u0026rsquo;ll be camped at Sunrise Ridge during exercise week, in the big field behind the Health Center.\nThe Cascadia Rising Earthquake Exercise Scenario On June 7th, one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history will (only hypothetically!) strike our region. It\u0026rsquo;s a practice exercise but it\u0026rsquo;s a vital one. We know the Cascadia fault ruptures every 300 to 500 years and the last one was in 1700, about 300 years ago. The earthquake clock is ticking.\nScientists who helped develop the scenario say coastal areas like Grays Harbor will be inundated when this magnitude 9.0 quake throws a 30 to 50 foot tsunami on unprotected shoreline. In Puget Sound, there would not be a tsunami but even at this distance from the coast, five minutes of severe shaking will injure hundreds. Here on Vashon, ferry connections to the mainland would be broken, power would be out for weeks and many buildings would be damaged. We would quickly run out of almost everything from food to medical supplies and fuel. We will need mainland help, and lots of it. And that\u0026rsquo;s the main focus of practicing with the National Guard and King County Office of Emergency Management.\nYour Questions Answered We\u0026rsquo;ve tried to anticipate questions you may have. Please flip this page over to see a Question and Answer section. Also, during exercise week, Voice of Vashon will be broadcasting coverage of the exercise and dozens of tips you can use to keep you and your family safe after a disaster.\nThanks for Having Us A Note from Lieutenant Colonel Kristen Derda The Washington National Guard has spent years preparing for a Cascadia earthquake disaster, working with partners at every level to develop a plan so we can assist our communities as quickly as possible when it happens... because we all know it WILL happen.\nDuring this exercise you will see National Guardsmen from the 181stBrigade Support around the Island with a few people arriving on the weekend of June 4th. Most of us get here on Monday, the 6th and we plan to depart the following weekend by the end of the day, June 12th.\nWe will be working side-by-side with local emergency management personnel to test our response capabilities. You may see some military vehicles, particularly when we move between our shore landing location at Jensen Point and the camp location in the fields at Sunrise Ridge. You will also see a few helicopter operations.\nThese exercises are as real-life as possible so our men and women can practice their response skills and work with all the tools we would use to support a humanitarian relief effort.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to understand that the Washington National Guard provides assistance to local jurisdictions only when requested. That happens when a community exhausts all its emergency resources. The National Guard then provides people and expertise to get relief to those who need it. That\u0026rsquo;s why we\u0026rsquo;re training closely with our local partners so we can understand their needs in advance, and they can understand the process to request and make best use of our help.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re excited by the challenge of this scenario and the chance to practice things that we hope we\u0026rsquo;ll never have to do here on Vashon. So, as a way to give back to the community for this opportunity, our soldiers will be providing community services under supervision of the Vashon Park District, revitalizing trails at Point Robinson and cleaning up some areas at Jensen Point beach.\nThank you for inviting the National Guard into your community to exercise our response plans together.\nQuestions \u0026amp; Answers on the Cascadia Rising Earthquake Exercise Q: Will the soldiers have guns?\nA: No, absolutely not. This is a humanitarian relief mission. The Brigade Support Battalion has no police powers and just doesn\u0026rsquo;t do that sort of work.\nQ: What does a \u0026ldquo;Brigade Support Battalion\u0026rdquo; do?\nA: The 181st soldiers are logistics experts. They move tons of supplies to where they are needed and distribute them, exactly what Vashon would need if the ferries were down or working only in a limited way.\nQ: Do we really need to store food, water and medicine at home?\nA: Emphatically, yes. For this very compressed exercise the National Guard will be arriving very quickly so we can do the training in the limited time available. But in a situation as bad as a real Cascadia quake, it would take weeks for this level of help to arrive.\nQ: I heard the National Guard will be coming in a big landing craft. Won\u0026rsquo;t that damage the beach at Jensen Point?\nA: The exercise had to pass an environmental assessment based on a dozen site visits including state and federal scientists, divers and aerial surveys. We don\u0026rsquo;t expect significant problems that way. Also, the National Guard policy is to fix any damage to facilities and the agreement with the Vashon Park District requires that as well.\nQ: What about Sunrise Ridge? Any impact there?\nA: The same kind of agreement is in place. The 181st will fix any damage to the facilities.\nQ: Will I still be able to access the Food Bank?\nA: Yes. We\u0026rsquo;ve planned things so Food Bank clients will easily be able to get to the warehouse using their regular route. We met with the Food Bank\u0026rsquo;s Executive Director to be sure we got it right.\nQ: What about access to the Health Center?\nA: We have been careful to avoid blocking any access to the Health Center. We met with the Health Center Manager to check our plans.\nQ: What will I hear and see at the Sunrise Ridge camp?\nA: The National Guard must train to go places where there may be no electricity and nearly 100 soldiers will be sleeping on site. Generators and lights will be going 24 hours a day. We\u0026rsquo;re trying to make contact with each of the immediate neighbors about that. So far, the response has been very welcoming.\nQ: What kinds of training will take place during this exercise?\nA: The Vashon Emergency Operations Center (EOC) will be activated under the direction of Fire Chief Hank Lipe as Incident Commander. A Liaison Team from the National Guard will be posted at the EOC with direct communications to the National Guard camp at Sunrise Ridge.\nQ: Anything we\u0026rsquo;ll see out in the community?\nA: There will be a food and water distribution demonstration. Plus, our Community Emergency Response Team has been practicing new Rapid Assessment procedure routes so the Incident Commander can get a handle on damage and other problems and set priorities as soon as possible after a quake. Those are just two examples.\nQ: How will injured people be helped after a big quake?\nA: Our volunteer Medical Reserve Corps (MRC) will be training on a Field Treatment Site operation designed to sustain injured until they can be taken to a hospital, which could be quite a long time with the ferries down and so many injured in the city. So, the National Guard will also be training CERT and MRC members on how to support medevac operations, including \u0026ldquo;hot load\u0026rdquo; procedures for putting patients aboard with the rotors turning to save time.\nQ: What will you do with all the food and supplies brought to the Island during the exercise?\nA: Actually, there won\u0026rsquo;t be much. Most of the operations will be done in simulation, moving \u0026ldquo;ghost\u0026rdquo; pallets of needed material on hypothetical planes, trucks and barges \u0026mdash;training on the techniques to request and track the resources.\nQ: Won\u0026rsquo;t the helicopter noise affect the Sheepdog Classic?\nA: Sunrise Ridge is 1.6 miles away and the airfield north of town is even farther. Pilots have been given instructions to stay clear of the trials and all helicopter operations will be completed by end of the day on the 9th so there will be no no choppers flying on the final three days.\n\u0026nbsp;\n"},{

  "content":" King County is investing in a new regional public emergency alert and notification system which features a public alert service - ALERT King County - to keep residents informed about significant events or emergency situations. ALERT King County replaces RPIN (Regional Public Information \u0026amp; Notification) and uses the capable CodeRED software to drive the system.\nThe new software offers enhanced features that allow officials to more precisely target messaging geographically, based on home and/or business addresses provided by subscribers.\nSoon we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to proactively send out a \u0026ldquo;boil water\u0026rdquo; alert if a water main breaks to just that area of the island, notify residents of one neighborhood of a chemical spill, or provide shelter locations and resource information following a disaster.\nDetails will evolve, but know that if you want to receive such notices all county residents are encouraged to sign up at www.KingCounty.gov/ALERTKingCounty to receive county \u0026ndash; and local \u0026ndash; alerts via telephone, text, and email. In the past these were pretty rare, and generally of high value, so I\u0026rsquo;d recommend signing up. It will also be possible to update your contact preferences in the future.\nThis system supplements all the other alerting systems, listed on VashonBePrepared's SignUp page. This will offer different capabilities than the excellent Voice Of Vashon Alert system, so sign up for both!\nIn addition, the system features an internal notification service \u0026ndash; KCInform \u0026ndash; for contacting employee and community groups, such as VashonBePrepared volunteers. We can selectively notify the EOC Team when the EOC is activating and ask when members of the team expect to arrive. CERT (Citizen Emergency Response Team) or our ACS (Auxiliary Communication Services) teams could use it to announce routine training sessions.\nAll of our volunteers have been entered into the new system and we anticipating trying it out in the coming weeks. If ready, it might even be used to notify VashonBeprepared volunteers during the upcoming Cascadia Rising Earthquake Exercise.\nDetails will evolve, but know that if you want to receive such notices you can already go to: www.KingCounty.gov/ALERTKingCounty to sign up for county \u0026ndash; and local - alerts! In the past these were pretty rare, and generally of high value, so I\u0026rsquo;d recommend signing up. It will also be possible to update your contact preferences in the future.\n"},{

  "content":"September is here, it's back to school time, the leaves are turning.. we've even had a bit of rain! The summer is drawing to a close, and I'm quietly glad, because I prefer the cool of autumn. As we shift our routines to the new season, it's a great time for procrastinators (we know who we are) to take those first steps toward household and neighborhood preparedness. The government has chosen September as National Preparedness Month.\u0026nbsp; Personally I think every month is Preparedness Month, but maybe that's just me :) \u0026nbsp;\nI like to keep the bar very low, and jump it joyfully. For instance, next time I'm chatting with my best pal back east, I'll remind her that I'm sharing her contact info with my west coast family, for the purpose of sharing our statuses after an earthquake or major storm. Boom - communication plan started! On the grocery list this week, I'll add a few cans of fruits and vegetables, or beans or chili or stew. Presto - food cache increased and updated. When I clean the sandals and sunhats out of the front hall closet to make room for the muck boots and parkas, I'll also empty the water jugs I keep in there. I can dump them onto the last of the garden veggies, and refill them with fresh water, putting today's date on the jugs with a piece of masking tape. Just like that, my water stores are a bit newer and tastier.\u0026nbsp; Making preparedness part of the routine is the easiest way I've found to be readier for whatever comes. I also like asking friends about their own plans - where do you store your water? Do you prefer liquid household bleach, or those fancy tablets you can get at REI? Do you really think you're ever going to want to eat that 5-year old ramen in your quake kit? In the wake of July's New Yorker article,\u0026nbsp; The Really Big One (and the followup article, How To Stay Safe When the Big One Comes),\u0026nbsp; Rick Wallace (VashonBePrepared's president) and I were invited by Susan McCabe to be guests on her show Island Crossroads, to talk about the risks of a major quake, and how we on Vashon can better prepare our households and neighborhoods. The live show was recorded and is available to stream on demand here:\u0026nbsp;\nhttp://www.voiceofvashon.org/user-content/island-crossroads-the-big-one Thanks for reading this blog, preparing your household, and organizing your neighborhood!

  "content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve waited weeks to write this post because the news reports have been quite disturbing. It’s been over a month now since the April 25th earthquake of magnitude 7.8 struck northwest of Kathmandu, Nepal, killing over 8,000 people and injuring many thousands. The local, regional and national governments of Nepal are overwhelmed, and leaders have called for international aid, which usually takes weeks to arrive. Conditions there are still very grim, people are not yet safe from further harm, and recovery will likely take many years. Aftershocks are to be expected. A second quake of nearly the same intensity struck east of Kathmandu soon after the inital quake, killing dozens more people and injuring more than a thousand, as well as toppling more buildings, causing more landslides, and interrupting the international recovery efforts that are just getting under way after the first quake. The initial quake has already been followed by at least six aftershocks of magnitude 5.0 or higher, including one that was 6.3. People are doubly traumatized by the repeated quakes and aftershocks, and many are still awaiting aid. (I\u0026rsquo;ll cover psychological resilience in a future post.) It\u0026rsquo;s tempting to think there is little relation between our own modern rural island near Seattle and Tacoma, and these remote high-mountain villages, towns and cities in a developing country with far less robust infrastructure than our own. But to ignore our common vulnerabilities would be a mistake. When critical systems and services fail, we are all thrust into survival mode in similar ways. We all depend on communications, transportation, distribution of food, water, medicines and health workers, availability of safe shelters, and reassurance of an eventual return to normalcy. The big difference between remote rural Nepal and close-in rural Vashon is our opportunity to prepare. With access to more resources ahead of such an incident, we can build robust go-kits and quake supply kits, to cover more of our needs for the days and weeks after an earthquake or other incident. With all this advance warning, we can connect now with neighbors and the larger community, to plan how we'll get and give help, and keep more people safe and comfortable, despite the partial or total disruption of our systems for communicating, distributing water, food and supplies, and getting around.\n\u0026nbsp;Experts have warned repeatedly that the western United States is overdue for a major quake from the Cascadia subduction zone. Governments and nonprofits are listening, and are working hard to prepare, but they acknowledge that no outside efforts will be sufficient, nor will they be deployed quickly enough to compensate for the potential issues we face. What can we do? We can be our own advance rescue team, one stored gallon of water, one can of food, one box of band-aids at a time. We can talk with our neighbors, family and friends about how we might communicate and help each other after a quake. We an plan, prepare, and practice. We can do this! Let\u0026rsquo;s start from where we are now, and keep upping our game with practices. Meanwhile, do support the recovery efforts in Nepal if you can. Vashon-local fundraisers are being held, combining good food and fun with community-building and support of our global neighbors near Kathmandu.\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\n"},{

  "content":"Last Thursday, FEMA and its partners released the 2015 National Preparedness Report (NPR). The NPR is an annual status report summarizing the Nation's progress toward reaching the 2011 National Preparedness Goal of a secure and resilient nation. This report marks the fourth iteration of the NPR. The 2015 NPR places particular emphasis on highlighting preparedness progress in implementing the National Planning Frameworks. The Frameworks describe how the whole community works together to achieve the Goal.\nThe report was developed to meet the requirements of Presidential Policy Directive 8/PPD-8: National Preparedness. PPD-8 is aimed at strengthening the security and resilience of the United States through systematic preparation for the threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk to the security of the Nation. The NPR also addresses several reporting requirements from the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA), including components of the Federal Preparedness Report and State Preparedness Report (SPR).\nThe 2015 report identifies 43 key findings across the Prevention, Protection, Mitigation, Response, and Recovery mission areas, in addition to six key overarching findings listed below:\nRecent events, including the epidemic of Ebola virus disease, have highlighted challenges with coordinating the response to and recovery from complex incidents that do not receive Stafford Act declarations. Businesses and public-private partnerships are increasingly incorporating emergency preparedness into technology platforms, such as Internet and social media tools and services. Environmental Response/Health and Safety, Intelligence and Information Sharing, and Operational Coordination are additional core capabilities to sustain, which are capabilities in which the Nation has developed acceptable levels of performance for critical tasks, but which face potential performance declines if not maintained and updated to address new challenges. Cybersecurity, Housing, Infrastructure Systems, and Long-term Vulnerability Reduction remained national areas for improvement, and Economic Recovery re-emerged as an area for improvement from 2012 and 2013. Access Control and Identity Verification is a newly identified national area for improvement. Perspectives from states and territories on their current levels of preparedness were similar to previous years. All 10 core capabilities with the highest self-assessment results in 2012 and 2013 remained in the top-10 for 2014; Cybersecurity continues to be the lowest-rated core capability in state and territory self-assessments. While Federal departments and agencies individually assess progress for corrective actions identified during national-level exercises and real-world incidents, challenges remain to comprehensively assess corrective actions with broad implications across the Federal Government. The NPR presents a national perspective, highlighting the contributions to preparedness made by the whole community—namely, Federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, the private and nonprofit sectors, faith-based organizations, communities, and individuals. The report also integrates data from the annual Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment process and State Preparedness Reports from the 56 states and territories. FEMA also conducted research to identify any recent independent evaluations, surveys, and other data related to the core capabilities.\nFor a copy of the full report go to: https://www.fema.gov/national-preparedness-report.\nQuestions can be directed to FEMA at: NPR@fema.dhs.gov.\nFor more information on national preparedness efforts, visit: http://www.fema.gov/national-preparedness.\n"},{

  "content":"Last night the Land Trust building was packed with this year's CERT (Community Emergency Response Organization) students, and with CERT alumni ready to celebrate and welcome the twenty-six graduates of the CERT class of 2015. This class is news for a number of reasons. It's the first class that was managed by Jan Milligan, who is putting her energetic spin on this revered program. This class features some younger participants, which Vashon's rather gray-haired preparedness community sorely needs. And this class is notable for the already-deep skills and extensive engagement of a number of the students.\nJan Milligan gave the students their new CERT gear. Then they sat patiently while about a dozen folks from various preparedness organizations spoke briefly to the class, to give them a sense of the rich landscape here on Vashon. Organizations and efforts represented included: VashonBePrepared, Vashon EOC (Emergency Operations Center), Vashon ACS (the new auxilliary communications service), Equestrian CERT and animal rescue preparedness, Vashon mass care and feeding, Vashon MRC (Medical Reserve Corps), VoiceOfVashon's Emergency Alert system, Vashon Island Fire \u0026amp; Rescue, and Vashon NERO. The class also heard from Shelby Edwards, a business continuity and disaster recovery expert and CERT alum who lives on Vashon, and Alisha Griswold, an emergency manager and disaster technologist at King County OEM (Office of Emergency Management), who also lives on Vashon. Leading up this powerhouse with some of the history behind CERT was Brigadier General (Ret.) Joe Ulatoski, considered by many to be one of the founders of preparedness on Vashon. Catherine Cochrane delivered the certificates to the class, and Assistant Fire Chief Bob Larsen closed out the ceremony with his thanks and the hope that they will continue with this work. It's always moving when a large group of Vashon preparedness volunteers gets together. These people represent a groundswell of passion and dedication to making the people (and animals) of Vashon safer during and after minor and major incidents.\u0026nbsp; This group \"gets it\" that in the first days and weeks after a major disaster, we will need to depend on each other and local resources to stay safe and comfortable. Looking out at the group of CERT grads, I couldn't help wondering what each of them will do next, now that their Friday nights are free. Some will hopefully continue in CERT to achieve REW (Registered Emergency Worker) status, with periodic training sessions, group drills and skills reviews. Some may choose a specific area on which to focus, such as medical or communications, and pursue further training in that direction. I hope that every single one will take the same energy that got them through this rigorous 40-hour class, and use some of those Friday nights to better organize their homes and neighborhoods. Congratulations CERT 2015 graduates!\n\u0026nbsp;\n"},{

  "content":"Have you been following the big snowstorms back east? I\u0026rsquo;ve been listening in as distant friends and family rush to prepare, then hunker down to wait out the blizzard. Supermarkets are getting low on fresh foods, as families stock up in advance of the storm. Friends and family relate how they\u0026rsquo;re getting in extra bottled water and wondering how to maintain home heat and refrigeration if the power goes out. Maybe the gas tanks of their cars aren\u0026rsquo;t full, but they live in cities where they can walk to many essential services. In a city, the household plan for staying safe and comfortable may rely on municipal services, utility companies, and emergency responders. On rural and isolated Vashon, we don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy such a robust infrastructure, so we need to prepare as best we can, and be ready to help each other if possible.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s even harder to imagine winter weather right now, when Vashon is experiencing an early spring of sunshine and 60-degree days! Yesterday the sunshine and warmth drew me out to the garage, where I noticed a generator that needs an oil change, a food cache that could use updating, and a tangled mess of bicycles and lawn furniture blocking access to the spare batteries and lightbulbs. How embarrassing! The foundations of a strong NERO are its households: members of a well-prepared household are far less likely to need help, and are better able to assist neighbors. Like you, I want to be part of the solution (not part of the problem), so I sorted out the mess, and shopped for some new canned foods. January is a great time for each of us to review the basics. Find lots of helpful ideas and lists at ready.gov, and remember that kids can be a big help in preparing at home. Already this year, a number of group captains have let me know that they plan to hold meetings and revive their neighborhood preparedness activities. Watch this spot and the local papers for some fun and inspiring NERO and household preparedness events throughout 2015! Now excuse me while I go change the oil in that generator…\n"},{

I for one was frustrated to have a localized NOAA forecast for 39\u0026deg; while snow remained on the ground all day.

Last week I started transmitting data from my personal site on north Vashon.\nWhile high quality gear can cost $500 to many thousands of dollars, I was able to scrape by on only $80.

(Caveat: I returned my 1st unit as it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t connect via USB. The 2nd has worked better.)

California would go from 200 to 400 sensors while 275 sensors are apparently all that are currently planned for Oregon and Washington.\nSpecialized systems have been in place for years. For instance the Alaskan Way Viaduct automatically is closed on an early warning system installed in June 2011.\nBased on a distributed set of sensors, the warnings travel at nearly the speed of light - while the seismic waves travel closer to the speed of sound. That adds up to a minute of advance warning for locations 150 miles away from the epicenter, and even 5 seconds of advance warnings allows elevators to brake, fire departments to open their doors, and other automated systems to kick in – potentially saving hundreds of millions through out a region.\n"},{

  "content":"Seattle to host Nov. 18th Twitter event to take questions about landslides\nDid you know that most landslides occur between the months of October and April? And that 86 percent of landslides are caused to some extent by human activity? Landslide season is upon us and the City of Seattle is urging residents to take preventive measures to protect themselves and their property from possible landslides. Heavy rains are likely this year for the Pacific Northwest. As the rainfall continues to increase throughout the fall, the threat of landslides will continue to rise in the winter. Experts agree there is no one single factor that contributes to landslides in the area. However, in most cases there are steps that property owners can take to reduce that risk. With 20,000 Seattle properties, most of which are residential, in landslide-prone areas, DPD encourages property owners to protect themselves from landslides. Learn how by participating in our Twitter Landslide Q\u0026amp;A event and speaking with our landslide expert. When: November 18, 12:00 \u0026ndash; 1:00 p.m. Where: @SeattleDPD on Twitter #seattlelandslides\nOur Q \u0026amp; A event will give you the opportunity to consult with our landslide expert and learn simple preventive measures that will help protect you from future landslides, such as: Checking downspouts; making sure they are functioning/routed to a safe location Inspecting sloped areas for indications of soil movement and erosion Keeping fill and yard waste off slopes Shutting off the irrigation system and checking it out seasonally Leaving tree stumps in the ground on slopes Knowing when to seek professional help for hillside projects Can\u0026rsquo;t participate in the event? Don\u0026rsquo;t worry; we have helpful information you can refer to on our Emergency Management page to let you know if you\u0026rsquo;re at risk and how to be prepared, such as:\nNarrated Landslide Presentation Interactive GIS Map Landslide Prone Area Map Dos \u0026amp; Don\u0026rsquo;ts \u0026nbsp;\nIf a landslide damages your property and you have an immediate concern for your safety, leave the premises and call 9-1-1. Property owners with structures that may be affected by or endangered by a landslide should contact a geotechnical professional for structural evaluation.

I actually think they know how to control it – when it fits their key goals.\nAs conclusive proof, realize that the NWS proclaimed this week as “Winter Weather Awareness Week”. As a direct result – not coincidentally as many naively assume – the nation is going to be plunged into dramatic Winter Weather. Is this a dramatic publicity stunt? One has to wonder.\nRegardless, whether we want it or not, be aware that Western Washington will be plunged into freezing weather over the next few days.

(The north end and Tahlequah and 5th Station 55 caches have yet to receive the latest updates, but received upgrades in the form of hand-me-downs from the other caches.)\nNotable upgrades include newly attached half tables that triple the working surface area, completely overhauled and simplified instructions for the stations, updated frequency lists \u0026ndash; including the island\u0026rsquo;s new repeater, removal of low priority CD radios, and upgrades from Win 98 to Win XP on the Winlink (email over radio) modems and computers.\nAfter a significant sugar infusion (courtesy of a major homemade cookie break) and opportunity to try out the LACC hands-on, the second half of the program commenced.\nBob Smueles brought the club up to speed on the newly installed repeater on Sunrise Ridge: KG7CM (for now), 433.775MHz\u0026nbsp;(+5MHz, 103.5 tone). Initiated by former islander Randy Bardwell, who envisioned and created a software based, highly flexible repeater, this model was traded for a solid surplus police GE Master 3 repeater with a better frequency than we had previously had access to. The new repeater has superior clarity and a number of features we may take advantage of in the future.\nMajor kudos were given to Tim Hardy (local and state\u0026rsquo;s MARS expert) for his donations of valuable equipment and expertise, John Galus who did much of the programming work, as well as Rick Wallace and the Voice of Vashon for facility work and additional funding support.\nCERT and Ham members present discussed holding a day of hands on practice to gain familiarity with the LACCs and new repeater.

  "content":"The recent August 24, 2014 earthquake outside of Napa, California again demonstrated the seismic risk posed by a building’s nonstructural components. In general, the components of a building’s structural system that support the building and keep it standing—the frame, walls, and roof—performed very well in the Napa Valley earthquake. However, the nonstructural components of a building—the cladding, interior walls, ceilings, utilities, and contents – were responsible for more than 90 percent of the damage.\nFor more than 30 years, FEMA has been developing and disseminating technical guidance to improve the seismic safety of new and existing buildings, one of its responsibilities under the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP). FEMA is continuing that role with the publication of Reducing the Risks of Nonstructural Earthquake Damage—A Practical Guide, Fourth Edition (FEMA E-74 CD).\nIn 2013, FEMA completed an updated, interactive fourth edition, FEMA E-74 Reducing the Risks of Nonstructural Earthquake Damage, designed primarily for online use. FEMA E-74 includes information on the behavior of nonstructural components in earthquakes and the consequences of damage; survey and assessment procedures for nonstructural components in existing buildings; nonstructural hazard reduction programs for existing buildings and new construction; and detailed illustrations of possible earthquake damage and mitigation measures for a variety of nonstructural components. The updated fourth edition covers about 70 different examples of nonstructural components, compared to about 12 examples in the previous edition, and incorporates examples from three major earthquakes in Chile, New Zealand, and Japan. The Structural Engineers Association of California (SEAOC) awarded FEMA E-74 and its developers the SEAOC Award of Excellence.\nThe new FEMA E-74 CD includes the PDF version of FEMA E-74 and a training resource developed by the Applied Technology Council (ATC): instructor and student materials for 4- to 5-hour live training classes. This past year, thousands have been trained in FEMA E-74 via webinars held across the United States and via In-person training classes. Audiences for FEMA E-74 and FEMA E-74 CD include building owners and managers, maintenance personnel, store or office managers, corporate or agency department heads, risk managers, and safety personnel. For the future, FEMA and its partners will continue to incorporate new data on nonstructural failures into FEMA E-74.\nTo order your copy of FEMA E-74 CD from the FEMA Publications Warehouse, call 1-800-480-2520 or fax your request to 1-240-699-0525, FEMA Publication Order Form.\nTo view or download FEMA E-74 or other FEMA earthquake publications and products, visit FEMA Earthquake.\n"},{

  "content":" This map shows, in purple and pink, the west-east line of magnetotelluric sensors that were placed north of Washington state’s Mount Rainier to study the volcanic plumbing system under the volcano. The sensors detect how the ground resists or conducts natural electricity within the Earth. Shown in yellow are seismic sensors that detect how fast or slow sound or seismic waves travel underground. Both methods were used in a new study that provides the most detailed look yet at the subterranean plumbing system that supplies the active volcano. Photo Credit: R Shane McGary, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\nJuly 17, 2014 – By measuring how fast Earth conducts electricity and seismic waves, a University of Utah researcher and colleagues made a detailed picture of Mount Rainier’s deep volcanic plumbing and partly molten rock that will erupt again someday.\n“This is the most direct image yet capturing the melting process that feeds magma into a crustal reservoir that eventually is tapped for eruptions,” says geophysicist Phil Wannamaker, of the university’s Energy \u0026amp; Geoscience Institute and Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. “But it does not provide any information on the timing of future eruptions from Mount Rainier or other Cascade Range volcanoes.”\nThe study was published today in the journal Nature by Wannamaker and geophysicists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, the College of New Jersey and the University of Bergen, Norway.\nIn an odd twist, the image appears to show that at least part of Mount Rainier’s partly molten magma reservoir is located about 6 to 10 miles northwest of the 14,410-foot volcano, which is 30 to 45 miles southeast of the Seattle-Tacoma area.\nBut that could be because the 80 electrical sensors used for the experiment were placed in a 190-mile-long, west-to-east line about 12 miles north of Rainier. So the main part of the magma chamber could be directly under the peak, but with a lobe extending northwest under the line of detectors, Wannamaker says.\nThe top of the magma reservoir in the image is 5 miles underground and “appears to be 5 to 10 miles thick, and 5 to 10 miles wide in east-west extent,” he says. “We can’t really describe the north-south extent because it’s a slice view.”\nWannamaker estimates the reservoir is roughly 30 percent molten. Magma chambers are like a sponge of hot, soft rock containing pockets of molten rock.\nThe new image doesn’t reveal the plumbing tying Mount Rainier to the magma chamber 5 miles below it. Instead, it shows water and partly molten and molten rock are generated 50 miles underground where one of Earth’s seafloor crustal plates or slabs is “subducting” or diving eastward and downward beneath the North America plate, and how and where those melts rise to Rainier’s magma chamber.\nThe study was funded largely by the National Science Foundation’s Earthscope program, which also has made underground images of the United States using seismic or sound-wave tomography, much like CT scans show the body’s interior using X-rays.\nThe new study used both seismic imaging and magnetotelluric measurements, which make images by showing how electrical and magnetic fields in the ground vary due to differences in how much underground rock and fluids conduct or resist electricity.\nWannamaker says it is the most detailed cross-section view yet under a Cascades volcanic system using electrical and seismic imaging. Earlier seismic images indicated water and partly molten rock atop the diving slab. The new image shows melting “from the surface of the slab to the upper crust, where partly molten magma accumulates before erupting,” he adds.\nWannamaker and Rob L. Evans, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, conceived the study. First author R Shane McGary – then at Woods Hole and now at the College of New Jersey – did the data analysis. Other co-authors were Jimmy Elsenbeck of Woods Hole and Stéphane Rondenay of the University of Bergen.\nMount Rainier: Hazardous Backdrop to Metropolitan Seattle-Tacoma\nMount Rainier, the tallest peak in the Cascades, “is an active volcano that will erupt again,” says the U.S. Geological Survey. Rainier sits atop volcanic flows up to 36 million years old. An ancestral Rainier existed 2 million to 1 million years ago. Frequent eruptions built the mountain’s modern edifice during the past 500,000 years. During the past 11,000 years, Rainier erupted explosively dozens of times, spewing ash and pumice.\nRainier once was taller until it collapsed during an eruption 5,600 years ago to form a large crater open to the northeast, much like the crater formed by Mount St. Helens’ 1980 eruption. The 5,600-year-old eruption sent a huge mudflow west to Puget Sound, covering parts or all of the present sites of the Port of Tacoma, Seattle suburbs Kent and Auburn, and the towns Puyallup, Orting, Buckley, Sumner and Enumclaw.\nRainier’s last lava flows were 2,200 years ago, the last flows of hot rock and ash were 1,100 years ago and the last big mudflow 500 years ago. There are disputed reports of steam eruptions in the 1800s.\nSubduction Made Simple – and a Peek beneath a Peak\nThe “ring of fire” is a zone of active volcanoes and frequent earthquake activity surrounding the Pacific Ocean. It exists where Earth’s tectonic plates collide – specifically, plates that make up the seafloor converge with plates that carry continents.\nFrom Cape Mendocino in northern California and north past Oregon, Washington state and into British Columbia, an oceanic plate is being pushed eastward and downward – a process called subduction – beneath the North American plate. This relatively small Juan de Fuca plate is located between the huge Pacific plate and the Pacific Northwest.\nThis image was made by measuring how the ground conducts or resists electricity in a study co-authored by geophysicist Phil Wannamaker of the University of Utah Energy \u0026amp;amp; Geoscience Institute. It shows the underground plumbing system that provides molten and partly molten rock to the magma chamber beneath the Mount Rainier volcano in Washington state. The scale at left is miles depth. The scale at bottom is miles from the Pacific Coast. The Juan de Fuca plate of Earth’s Pacific seafloor crust and upper mantle is shown in blue on the left half of the image as it dives or “subducts” eastward beneath Washington state. The reddish orange and yellow colors represent molten and partly molten rock forming atop the Juan de Fuca plate or “slab.” The image shows the rock begins to melt about 50 miles beneath Mount Rainier (the red triangle at top). Some is pulled downward and eastward as the slab keeps diving, but other melts move upward to the orange magma chamber shown under but west of Mount Rainier. The line of sensors used to make this image were placed north of the 14,410-foot peak, so the image may be showing a lobe of the magma chamber that extends northwest of the mountain. Red ovals on the left half of the page are the hypocenters of earthquakes.\nPhoto Credit: R Shane McGary, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\nNew seafloor rock – rich with water in cracks and minerals – emerges from an undersea volcanic ridge some 250 miles off the coast, from northern California into British Columbia. That seafloor adds to the western edge of the Juan de Fuca plate and pushes it east-northeast under the Pacific Northwest, as far as Idaho.\nThe part of the plate diving eastward and downward is called the slab, which ranges from 30 to 60 miles thick as it is jammed under the North American plate. The part of the North American plate above the diving slab is shaped like a wedge.\nWhen the leading, eastern edge of the diving slab descends deep enough, where pressures and temperatures are high, water-bearing minerals such as chlorite and amphibole release water from the slab, and the slab and surrounding mantle rock begin to melt. That is why the Cascade Range of active volcanoes extends north-to-south – above the slab and parallel but about 120 miles inland from the coast – from British Columbia south to Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak in northern California.\nIn the new image, yellow-orange-red areas correspond to higher electrical conductivity (or lower resistivity) in places where fluids and melts are located.\nThe underground image produced by the new study shows where water and molten rock accumulate atop the descending slab, and the route they take to the magma chamber that feeds eruptions of Mount Rainier:\n– The rock begins to melt atop the slab about 50 miles beneath Mount Rainier. Wannamaker says it is best described as partly molten rock that contains about 2 percent water and “is a mush of crystals within an interlacing a network of molten rock.”\n– Some water and partly molten rock actually gets dragged downward atop the descending slab, to depths of 70 miles or more.\n– Other partly molten rock rises up through the upper mantle wedge, crosses into the crust at a depth of about 25 miles, and then rises into Rainier’s magma chamber – or at least the lobe of the chamber that crosses under the line of sensors used in the study. Evidence suggests the magma moves upward at least 0.4 inches per year.\nThe new magnetotelluric image also shows a shallower zone of fluid perhaps 60 miles west of Rainier and 25 miles deep at the crust-mantle boundary. Wannamaker says it is largely water released from minerals as the slab is squeezed and heated as it dives.\nThe seismic data were collected during 2008-2009 for other studies. The magnetotelluric data were gathered during 2009-2010 by authors of the new study.\nWannamaker and colleagues placed an east-west line of magnetotelluric sensors: 60 that made one-day measurements and looked as deep as 30 miles into the Earth, and 20 that made measurements for a month and looked at even greater depths.\nThe Energy \u0026amp; Geoscience Institute at the University of Utah employs more than 100 scientists and staff, and conducts the world’s largest, university-based, cost-shared research program focusing on oil, gas and geothermal exploration and production. The institute perhaps is known best for its international hydrocarbon research consortium sponsored by more than 70 global energy corporations. Wannamaker does research worldwide as a principal investigator in the institute’s geothermal group.\n\u0026#160;\n- From http://unews.utah.edu/news_releases/new-view-of-rainiers-volcanic-plumbing-2/\nAlso see: http://dailydigestnews.com/2014/07/study-mount-rainier-will-erupt-again/ and\nwww.newsmax.com/SciTech/Mount-Rainier-Volcano-Eruption/2014/07/18/id/583588/\n"},{

  "content":"From http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/new-insight-on-the-nations-earthquake-hazards/\n“Important changes in Washington are related to the addition of the Tacoma fault and changes to the South Whidbey Island fault. The Seattle region hazard has not changed significantly because we use a very similar model for the Seattle fault as was applied in 2008. We have not modified this fault using the geodetic model.” from the USGS report, Pg. 192\nBy: Jessica Robertson (jrobertson@usgs.gov) and Mark Petersen (mpetersen@usgs.gov)\n2014 USGS National Seismic Hazard Map, displaying intensity of potential ground shaking from an earthquake in 50 years (which is the typical lifetime of a building).\nTo help make the best decisions to protect communities from earthquakes, new USGS maps display how intense ground shaking could be across the nation.\nThe USGS recently updated their U.S. National Seismic Hazard Maps, which reflect the best and most current understanding of where future earthquakes will occur, how often they will occur, and how hard the ground will likely shake as a result.\n42 States at Risk; 16 States at High Risk\nStudents conduct the “drop, cover, hold on” safety procedure during an earthquake preparedness drill. Photo Credit: Jessica Robertson, USGS\nWhile all states have some potential for earthquakes, 42 of the 50 states have a reasonable chance of experiencing damaging ground shaking from an earthquake in 50 years (the typical lifetime of a building). Scientists also conclude that 16 states have a relatively high likelihood of experiencing damaging ground shaking. These states have historically experienced earthquakes with a magnitude 6 or greater.\nThe hazard is especially high along the west coast, intermountain west, and in several active regions of the central and eastern U.S., such as near New Madrid, MO, and near Charleston, SC. The 16 states at highest risk are Alaska, Arkansas, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.\nWhile these overarching conclusions of the national-level hazard are similar to those of the previous maps released in 2008, details and estimates differ for many cities and states. Several areas have been identified as being capable of having the potential for larger and more powerful earthquakes than previously thought due to more data and updated earthquake models. The most prominent changes are discussed below.\nInformed Decisions Based on the Maps\nWith an understanding of potential ground shaking levels, various risk analyses can be calculated by considering factors like population levels, building exposure, and building construction practices. This is used for establishing building codes, and in the analysis of seismic risk for key structures. This can also help in determining insurance rates, emergency preparedness plans, and private property decisions such as re-evaluating one’s home and making it more resilient.\nThese maps are part of USGS contributions to the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP), which is a congressionally-established partnership of four federal agencies with the purpose of reducing risks to life and property in the U.S. that result from earthquakes. The contributing agencies are the USGS, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), National Institute of Standards and Technology, and National Science Foundation (NSF). As an example of the collaboration, the hazards identified in the USGS maps underlie FEMA-sponsored seismic design provisions that are incorporated into building codes adopted by states and localities. The maps also reflect investments in research by academic and other scientists supported by grants from the USGS and the NSF.\n“The standards for seismic safety in building codes are directly based upon USGS assessments of potential ground shaking from earthquakes, and have been for years,” said Jim Harris, a member and former chair of the Provisions Update Committee of the Building Seismic Safety Council.\n“The committees preparing those standards welcome this updated USGS information as a basis for making decisions and continuing to ensure the most stable and secure construction.”\nKey Updates\nEast Coast\nThe eastern U.S. has the potential for larger and more damaging earthquakes than considered in previous maps and assessments. As one example, scientists learned a lot following the magnitude 5.8 earthquake that struck Virginia in 2011. It was among the largest earthquakes to occur along the east coast in the last century, and helped determine that even larger events are possible. Estimates of earthquake hazards near Charleston, SC, have also gone up due to the assessment of earthquakes in the state.\nIn New York City, the maps indicate a slightly lower hazard for tall buildings than previously thought (but still a hazard nonetheless). Scientists estimated a lower likelihood for slow shaking from an earthquake near the city. Slow shaking is likely to cause more damage to tall structures in contrast, compared to fast shaking which is more likely to impact shorter structures.\nCentral U.S.\nThe New Madrid Seismic Zone has been identified to have a larger range of potential earthquake magnitudes and locations than previously identified. This is a result of a range of new research, part of which was recently compiled by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\nWest Coast\nIn California, earthquake hazard extends over a wider area than previously thought. Most notably, faults were recently discovered, raising earthquake hazard estimates for San Jose, Vallejo and San Diego. On the other hand, new insights on faults and rupture processes reduced earthquake hazard estimates for Irvine, Santa Barbara and Oakland. Hazard increased in some parts of the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles region and decreased in other parts. These updates were from the new Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast Model, which incorporates many more potential fault ruptures than did previous assessments. Recent earthquakes in Alaska, Mexico and New Zealand taught scientists more about complex ruptures and how faults can link together. This insight was applied to California for which approximately 250,000 potential complex ruptures were modeled.\nNew research on the Cascadia Subduction Zone resulted in increased estimates of earthquake magnitude up to magnitude 9.3. Deep-sea cores were collected that show evidence within the sea-floor sediments of large earthquake-generated mudflows. Earthquake shaking estimates were also increased following abundant data gathered from the magnitude 9.0 earthquake in Tohoku, Japan in 2011 and the magnitude 8.2 earthquake offshore of Chile in 2014, as those events ruptured along subduction zones similar to the Pacific Northwest zone.\nDamage to the Washington National Cathedral in DC from the earthquake in Virginia on August 23, 2011. Photo Credit: William Leith, USGS\nIn Washington, scientists incorporated new knowledge of the Tacoma Fault into the maps [emphasis added] and identified changes to the geometry of the Whidbey Island fault in the northern Puget Sound. Earthquake hazard also increased for Las Vegas because of new science. In Utah, scientists dug trenches to study prehistoric earthquakes along the Wasatch Fault. While the overall seismic hazard didn’t change significantly, detailed changes were made to the fault models in this region and robust data were acquired to hone the assessments. This is valuable since approximately 75% of Utah’s population, including the residents of Salt Lake City, lives near this fault.\nThe magnitude 7.9 earthquake in Wenchuan, China in 2008 provided many new records of shaking that are very similar to anticipated future earthquakes in the western U.S., as the fault structures are similar. Previously, scientists did not have nearly as many shaking records from earthquakes of this size.\nInduced Earthquakes … Research Underway\nSome states have experienced increased seismicity in the past few years that may be associated with human activities such as the disposal of wastewater in deep wells.\nOne specific focus for the future is including an additional layer to these earthquake hazard maps to account for recent potentially triggered earthquakes that occur near some wastewater disposal wells. Injection-induced earthquakes are challenging to incorporate into hazard models because they may not behave like natural earthquakes and their rates change based on man-made activities.\nYou Can’t Plan If … “USGS earthquake science is vital because you can’t plan for earthquakes if you don’t know what you are planning for,” said Mark Petersen, Chief of the USGS National Seismic Hazard Mapping Project. “Our nation’s population and exposure to large earthquakes has grown tremendously in recent years. The cost of inaction in planning for future earthquakes and other natural disasters can be very high, as demonstrated by several recent damaging events across the globe. It is important to understand the threat you face from earthquakes at home and the hazards for the places you might visit. The USGS is dedicated to applying the best available science in developing reliable products useful for reducing the earthquake risk across the U.S.”\nStart with USGS Science\nThe USGS is the only federal agency with responsibility for recording and reporting earthquake activity nationwide and providing a seismic hazard assessment. The USGS regularly updates the national seismic hazard models and maps, typically every 6 years, in sync with the building code updates. The 2014 update focuses on the conterminous U.S. Maps are also available for Alaska (last updated in 2007); Hawaii (1998); Puerto Rico (2003); Guam and Marianna Islands (2012); and American Samoa (2012).\nView the maps online at: here\n"},{

The last survey done in 1980 doesn’t have the resolution or clarity that is now available – though it famously aided identification of the previously unknown Seattle Fault. Lidar takes advantage of reflected laser light – using sophisticated algorithms to discard ‘false’ reflections from trees and vegetation. Thus the ground is laid bare of that vegetation and elevation maps – accurate to about half a centimeter – can be mapped by an survey airplane for a 1 kilometer wide swath. (If needed, better resolutions can be achieved by flying at lower elevations and mapping a narrower swath.)\nThe new mapping will:\nreveal new areas of slide risks Possibly clear areas previously thought to be at risk predict the potential type of slide suggest likely paths and areas covered by a debris field \u0026#160;\nAny new or existing risk areas will get noted on property owners titles, notifying potential buyers of the current status/risk.

  "content":" Friday February 21, 2014, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved Voice of Vashon’s (VoV) application for an FM radio station – along with over 1000 other low-power FM applicants nationwide. Fourteen years ago a small group of volunteers dared to dream that Vashon could have its own live radio voice. Now, that dream has come true.\nWhile much of the infrastructure is in place for the station to go live, a new FM transmitter, a new cadre of volunteers, and some $50K is needed to take this the final mile.\nVoV’s Emergency Alert System coverage will be much improved with this additional transmitter on FM. The 1650AM bulletins will be repeated on the FM station. The FM broadcasts will not be restricted to Traveler Information (as the AM station is, under their Travelers' Information Station permit - also known as Highway Advisory Radio), so new opportunities for entertainment and music broadcasting will be opened up for this new station – and Vashon.\nRead more about this exciting news for our community at www.voiceofvashon.org/?p=829\n"},{

Regrettably, in a total of 880 natural catastrophes (average of the past ten years: 790), more than 20,000 people were killed. This meant that the death toll was higher than in 2012, but significantly below the average of the past ten years (106,000). \u0026quot;Nowhere in the world is the rising number of natural catastrophes more evident than in North America, where the number of weather-related loss events has almost quintupled over the past three decades.” (USA Today)\nBased on the final graphic here, I wonder if the cost of the disasters is borne by those producing the most greenhouse gases?!\n\u0026#160;\n- Full Story: www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2014/01/07/global-natural-disasters/4342043/\n- Press release \u0026amp; graphics: www.munichre.com/en/media_relations/press_releases/2014/2014_01_07_press_release.aspx\n"},{

Notice how for buoyancy-driven eruptions (in blue), the time between eruptions doesn’t vary much across a wide range of volumes. Image: Figure 3 from Caricchi and others (2014), Nature Geoscience.\nThe study’s upshot is that Yellowstone Caldera (and the other 20+ supervolcano sites) are more likely than previously thought to explode without the aid of an earthquake. A big one could drastically lower global temperatures for years. Fortunately it sounds like we’ll still get ten years advance warning.\nGround-breaking work sheds new light on volcanic activity Factors determining the frequency and magnitude of volcanic phenomena have been uncovered by an international team of researchers.\nExperts from the Universities of Geneva, Bristol and Savoie carried out over 1.2 million simulations to establish the conditions in which volcanic eruptions of different sizes occur. The team used numerical modeling and statistical techniques to identify the circumstances that control the frequency of volcanic activity and the amount of magma that will be released.\nThe researchers, including Professor Jon Blundy and Dr. Catherine Annen from Bristol University's School of Earth Sciences, showed how different size eruptions have different causes. Small, frequent eruptions are known to be triggered by a process called magma replenishment, which stresses the walls around a magma chamber to breaking point. However, the new research shows that larger, less frequent eruptions are caused by a different phenomenon known as magma buoyancy, driven by slow accumulation of low-density magma beneath a volcano.\nPredictions of the scale of the largest possible volcanic eruption on earth have been made using this new insight. This is the first time scientists have been able to establish a physical link between the frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions and their findings will be published today in the journal Nature Geoscience.\n\u0026quot;We estimate that a magma chamber can contain a maximum of 35,000 km3 of eruptible magma. Of this, around 10 per cent is released during a super-eruption, which means that the largest eruption could release approximately 3,500 km3 of magma\u0026quot;, explained lead researcher Luca Caricchi, assistant professor at the Section of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Geneva and ex-research fellow at the University of Bristol.\nVolcanic eruptions may be frequent yet their size is notoriously hard to predict. For example, the Stromboli volcano in Italy ejects magma every ten minutes and would take two days to fill an Olympic swimming pool. However, the last super-eruption of a volcano, which occurred over 70,000 years ago, spewed out enough magma to fill a billion swimming pools. This new research identifies the main physical factors involved in determining the frequency and size of eruptions and is essential to understanding phenomena that effect human life, such as the 2010 ash cloud caused by the eruption of Eyjafallajökull in Iceland. Professor Jon Blundy said: \u0026quot;Some volcanoes ooze modest quantities of magma at regular intervals, whereas others blow their tops in infrequent super-eruptions. Understanding what controls these different types of behavior is a fundamental geological question. \u0026quot;Our work shows that this behavior results from interplay between the rate at which magma is supplied to the shallow crust underneath a volcano and the strength of the crust itself. Very large eruptions require just the right (or wrong!) combination of magma supply and crustal strength.\u0026quot;\n-- www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-01/uob-gws010314.php\nMore:\nhttp://natmonitor.com/2014/01/06/supereruptions-triggered-by-melt-buoyancy-study-finds/ http://scienceblog.com/69289/supervolcano-eruptions-triggered-by-melt-buoyancy/ www.independent.co.uk/news/science/risk-of-supervolcano-eruption-big-enough-to-affect-the-world-far-greater-than-thought-say-scientists-9040073.html "},{

The newly released “Cascadia Subduction Zone Earthquakes: A Magnitude 9.0 Earthquake Scenario” examines how the Pacific Northwest may fare after the next great ‘megathrust’ earthquake and tsunami. “The new report conveys the most current scientific and emergency planning information accessible to a wide variety of audiences.” said Tamra Biasco of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, one of the lead authors.\nThe new report by the Cascadia Region Earthquake Workgroup (CREW) summarizes not only why these earthquakes occur repeatedly, but also the likely consequences of the next Cascadia fault rupture. Future Cascadia earthquakes and tsunamis will have lasting impacts to coastal communities and the potential to inflict tens of billions of dollars in physical damage, dramatically impacting the region’s economy.\nWritten by a team of social scientists, emergency managers, earth scientists, engineers, public administrators, and businessmen under the umbrella of CREW, the new scenario provides a guide to citizens curious about the geologic processes that make the Pacific Northwest so rich in natural beauty and resources, to planners wanting to know what hazards they face, and to policy makers striving to make the Pacific Northwest more resilient.\u0026#160; The newly released “Cascadia Subduction Zone Earthquakes: A Magnitude 9.0 Earthquake Scenario” can be found here and other free preparedness materials to help Cascadia residents, schools, businesses, and emergency managers become better prepared for future earthquakes are accessible under products.\u0026#160; Production of the new scenario was made possible with support from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and CREW’s member organizations.\u0026#160; From heidi.kandathil’s post to www.crew.org/news-events/blog/crew-releases-new-cascadia-earthquake-tsunami-scenario\nAlso see the King5 Report on this:\nwww.king5.com/news/environment/seattle-magnitude-9-earthquake-report-228171731.html\nOr just read the report directly.

  "content":"BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A PROCLAMATION\nTime and again, America faces crises that test our readiness and challenge our resolve -- from natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods to shootings, cyber incidents, and even acts of terrorism. While my Administration is working tirelessly to avert national tragedies, it is every American's responsibility to be prepared. By planning for emergencies, individuals can protect themselves and their families while also contributing to their communities' resilience. During National Preparedness Month, we refocus our efforts on readying ourselves, our families, our neighborhoods, and our Nation for any crisis we may face.\nMy Administration is committed to preparing our country for the full range of threats. In the face of an emergency, we will continue to cut through red tape and bolster coordination. At my direction, the Federal Emergency Management Agency will launch a comprehensive campaign to build and sustain national preparedness with private sector, non-profit, and community leaders and all levels of government. The campaign will be based on science, research and development, public outreach, and broad participation. It will aim to inspire Americans of all ages to increase their preparedness by moving from awareness to action.\nOver this past year, ordinary Americans have stepped up in moments of trial and tragedy to perform real acts of heroism. Despite the brave actions of first responders across America, neighbors and friends are often the first on the scene after an emergency, and circumstances can call anyone to become a hero. This year's National Preparedness Month theme, \u0026quot;You Can Be the Hero,\u0026quot; asks all Americans to ready themselves to assist in case of emergency. Anyone can improve their preparedness by making or reviewing emergency plans with their family and by building a disaster kit with food, water, and essential supplies. Visit www.Ready.gov or www.Listo.gov to see which types of disasters are most likely for your area and learn more about what you can do to prepare.\nThis month, as we reflect on challenges to our communities, regions, and our Nation, we continue to lend our support to recovery efforts, and we honor our first responders by doing our part to build a more resilient America.\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 2013 as National Preparedness Month. I encourage all Americans to recognize the importance of preparedness and work together to enhance our national security, resilience, and readiness.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand thirteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-eighth.\nBARACK OBAMA\n"},{

  "content":"\nWhile scientists can't predict when a great earthquake producing a pan-Pacific tsunami will occur, thanks to new tools being developed by federal and state officials, scientists can now offer more accurate insight into the likely impacts when tsunamis occur. This knowledge can lead officials and the public to reduce the risk of the future tsunamis that will impact the west coast. \u0026#160; Maximum current speeds for the Port of Los Angeles (POLA) and the Port of Long Beach (POLB), according to the SAFRR Tsunami Scenario. In the POLA, currents are strongest at Angels Gate, the Cabrillo Marina, the Boat Yard, and the old Navy Yard. Once the tsunami event is underway, navigation through the Gate would be very dangerous. In the Cabrillo Marina and Boat Yard, currents are likely strong enough to break apart floating docks, damage piles, and pull small vessels from their mooring lines. The strongest currents are found in the old Navy Yard; however there are no exposed floating assets in this immediate area. At the POLB, again strong currents are found at the Gate. Also in the POLB, strong and jet-like currents are predicted at the entrance to the main cargo container area (Pier J). Currents here may be strong enough to damage, and possible break, mooring lines. Photo Credit: SAFRR Tsunami Scenario. (Larger image)\nWhat are the potential economic impacts? Which marinas could be destroyed? Who needs to be prepared for evacuations? A newly published report looks at these factors and more. \u0026#160; A hypothetical yet plausible scenario was developed where a tsunami is created by an earthquake offshore from the Alaskan peninsula and extends to the California coast. This is detailed in a new report titled, the U.S. Geological Survey's Science Application for Risk Reduction (SAFRR) Tsunami Scenario.\nWhile the report analyzed damage to California exclusively, the entire West Coast would face impact as shown by Figure 1, depicting predicted maximum wave heights.\nSome of the issues highlighted in the scenario include public safety and economic loss. In this scenario approximately 750,000 people would need to be evacuated, with 90,000 of those being tourists and visitors. Additionally, one-third of the boats in California's marinas could be damaged or completely sunk, resulting in $700 million in losses. It was concluded that neither of California's nuclear power plants would likely be damaged by this particular event.\nLooking back to 2011, not only was Japan devastated by the magnitude 9.1 Tohoku earthquake, but the resulting tsunami also swept through California and caused $50-100 million of damage. This shows that tsunamis near and far can lead to billions of dollars in losses in California.\nThe SAFRR Tsunami Scenario is a collaborative effort between the USGS, the California Geological Survey, the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, other agencies, and academic and other institutions.\nThis scenario will also be the focus of discussion at a workshop series starting September 4 that is convened in partnership with the California Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program. USGS scientists and partners will explain the scenario and results to stakeholders in the coastal communities of California. The workshops aims to establish a community of experts while fostering the use of science in decision-making.\n"},{

In order to receive WEAs, you must have a capable device and be located in an area (e.g., county) targeted by Authorized Senders to receive one of 3 types of alerts:\nPresidential Alerts – Alerts issued by the President or a designee; Imminent Threat Alerts – Alerts that include severe man-made or natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, etc., where an imminent threat to life or property exists; and AMBER Alerts– Alerts that meet the U.S. Department of Justice's criteria to help law enforcement search for and locate an abducted child. \u0026#160;\nThe buzzes or beeps are delivered based on your proximity to the emergency, not based on your phone number or home location. So visitors to Puget Sound from Kansas should still receive local tsunami alerts.\nMessages are sent on a special wireless carrier channel called Cell Broadcast – not affected by regular cellphone traffic that would be heavy after an emergency. Cell towers broadcast the signal simultaneously to all mobile devices within their range. The free system does not track phones' whereabouts.\nEmergency alerts are enabled by default on devices capable of receiving them. Users can change their phone's message or alert message settings if desired.\nThe first actual use of this in CA was used Monday, August 5th for an Amber Alert. The system was first deployed in April 2012.\nMore info on Wireless Emergency Alerts:\nwww.fema.gov/wireless-emergency-alerts www.ready.gov/alerts www.ctia.org/consumer_info/safety/index.cfm/AID/12082 "},{

The horizontal grey line indicates the long-term average value for 1961–1990 (14°C).\nCasualties from extreme events rose over all due to a 23 factor increase in heat related fatalities. Positively, the report notes that there were less casualties from storms and floods – attributable to increased warning and preparedness efforts.\nA primary conclusion is that significant progress is being made in teasing apart long-term climate change from short-term natural fluxuations. Long-term cryosphere (glaciers, snow and glaciohydrology) monitoring is a critical need identified as a future priority.\n"},{

  "content":"The U.S. National Climatic Data Center’s (NCDC) announced that according to their 2012 weather and climate disasters information, 2012 saw 11 weather and climate disaster events each with losses exceeding $1 billion in damages. This makes 2012 the second costliest year since 1980, with a total of more than $110 billion in damages throughout the year. The 2012 total damages rank only behind 2005, which incurred $160 billion in damages due in part to four devastating land-falling hurricanes.\nThe 2012 billion-dollar events included seven severe weather and tornado events, two tropical cyclone events, and the yearlong drought and its associated wildfires. These 11 events killed over 300 people and had devastating economic effects on the areas impacted. With 11 events, 2012 also ranks second highest in total number of billion-dollar events behind 2011, which had 14 events.\nThe two major drivers of the damage costs in 2012 were Sandy at approximately $65 billion and the yearlong drought at approximately $30 billion. Sandy’s large size, with tropical storm force winds extending nearly 500 miles from the center, led to record storm surge, large-scale flooding, wind damage, and mass power outages along much of the East Coast.\nThe yearlong drought, which affected more than half the country for the majority of 2012, was the largest drought extent in the United States since the 1930s. U.S. Department of Agriculture Drought Disaster Declarations reached more than 2,600 of the Nation’s 3,143 counties. While drought impacts are often most costly to agricultural centers, their conditions also led to several devastating wildfires that burned over 9 million acres nationwide during 2012.\nSee NCDC’s Billion-Dollar Weather/Climate Disasters report for more information on the weather and climate events that have had the greatest economic impacts from 1980 to 2012.\n"},{

  "content":"If you have even been curious about the potential impact of all those various earthquakes that geologists have identified – and see which might have the largest impact for a general region like Vashon Island (i.e., parcel level damage estimates are NOT supported!), then check out the State Seismic Hazards Catalog.\nWhile many reports have previously quantified potential impacts from a variety of potential quakes, these 20 new scenarios are the first systemic analysis of potential casualties and damage. These scenarios also use a new version of HAZUS-MH modeling software – recently updated with new geographic data and now incorporating liquefaction modeling. Hosted by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNT), the scenarios describe the potential impacts on communities and their infrastructure — from homes to utilities — from large earthquakes on 20 major earthquake faults across the state.\nTacoma Fault Scenario\nFor instance the Tacoma fault (running right under Vashon actually) could unleash a magnitude 7.1 quake which might then displace some 12,000 households with more than 6,000 people injured throughout the region. The orange image above shows the King County specific damage possible, while the table below shows the entire potential damage to the entire region.\nA summary and detailed report of this scenario are available. From the summary comes the following list of potential damage to the entire region:\nTACOMA FAULT SCENARIO EARTHQUAKE End-to-end length of fault (kilometers) 68 Magnitude (M) of scenario earthquake 7.1 Number of counties impacted 16 Total injuries (*severity 1, 2, 3, 4) at 2:00 PM 6,070 Total number of buildings extensively damaged 4,457 Total number of buildings completely damaged 15,410 Income losses in millions $1,847 Displaced households 11,576 People requiring shelter (individuals) 7,146 Capital stock losses in millions $8,654 Debris total in millions of tons 2.95 Truckloads of debris (25 tons per truckload) 117,960 People without power (Day 1) 87,675 People without potable water (Day 1) 193,544 Table 1. Summary of significant losses in the M7.1 Tacoma fault earthquake scenario. Among the counties most likely to be affected are Grays Harbor, Jefferson, King, Kitsap, Mason, Pierce, and Thurston.\n*Injury severity levels: 1—requires medical attention, but not hospitalization; 2—not life-threatening, but does require hospitalization; 3—hospitalization required; may be life-threatening if not treated promptly; 4—victims are killed by the earthquake\n\u0026#160;\nBuilding Damage Estimates for the Tacoma Fault Scenario\nHAZUS runs estimate that about 84,296 buildings will be at least moderately damaged. This is over 4.00 % of the total number of buildings in the region. There are an estimated 4,457 buildings that will be damaged beyond repair. The definition of the ‘damage states’ is provided in Volume 1: Chapter 5 of the HAZUS technical manual. Table 3 above summaries the expected damage by general occupancy for the buildings in the region. Table 4 summaries the expected damage by general building type.\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160; \u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\n\u0026#160;\nThe State Seismic Hazards Catalog is intended to help citizens, businesses, and safety officials plan for better resilience to and recovery from a major earthquake.\nThe Washington State Earthquake Hazards Scenario Catalog contains loss estimates for a suite of earthquake scenarios. These scenarios were selected to represent reasonable estimates of the most serious earthquake hazards everywhere in Washington as a basis for planning. In most cases, these scenarios are realistic and have undergone rigorous peer review. Some of these scenarios, however, are hypothetical or speculative, and the recurrence interval, or average time between earthquakes, varies from a few tens of years to a few tens of thousands of years; however, all scenarios are consistent with data included the USGS National Seismic Hazard Map. The loss estimates were produced by Hazus-MH, which is a regional loss estimation tool produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Results are most accurate when aggregated on a county or regional scale. Modeled results depend on accurate inventories. The more complete the inventories, the more accurate the results. Because of their complexity, it is more difficult to estimate losses to lifelines (utility and transportation) than buildings. These data are not a substitute for site-specific investigations assessing the level of risk for an area. They cannot be used to determine the earthquake hazard at a specific locality. Such a determination requires a site-specific geotechnical investigation performed by a qualified practitioner.\u0026#160; \u0026#160; The effects from these and other earthquakes may vary significantly from what is depicted. \u0026#160; The Washington State Earthquake Hazards Scenario Catalog is the result of a collaborative effort by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (WADNR), the Washington Military Department Emergency Management Division (EMD), Western Washington University (WWU), Huxley College of the Environment, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), US Geological Survey (USGS) and URS Corporation.\nLocal Press Coverage:\nhttp://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2021019310_quakescenariosxml.html www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Just-how-devastating-will-earthquakes-be-in-4532382.php "},{

  "content":"Canadian scientists apply new methods to better understand Pacific coast earthquakes Understanding the size and frequency of large earthquakes along the Pacific coast of North America is of great importance, not just to scientists, but also to government planners and the general public. The only way to predict the frequency and intensity of the ground motion expected from large and giant \u0026quot;megathrust \u0026quot; earthquakes along Canada's west coast is to analyze the geologic record. A new study published today in the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences presents an exceptionally well-dated first record of earthquake history along the south coast of BC. Using a new high-resolution age model, a team of scientists meticulously identified and dated the disturbed sedimentary layers in a 40-metre marine sediment core raised from Effingham Inlet. The disturbances appear to have been caused by large and megathrust earthquakes that have occurred over the past 11,000 years. One of the co-authors of the study, Dr. Audrey Dallimore, Associate Professor at Royal Roads University explains: \u0026quot;Some BC coastal fjords preserve annually layered organic sediments going back all the way to deglacial times. In Effingham Inlet, on the west coast of Vancouver Island, these sediments reveal disturbances we interpret were caused by earthquakes. With our very detailed age model that includes 68 radiocarbon dates and the Mazama Ash deposit (a volcanic eruption that took place 6800 yrs ago); we have identified 22 earthquake shaking events over the last 11,000 years, giving an estimate of a recurrence interval for large and megathrust earthquakes of about 500 years. However, it appears that the time between major shaking events can stretch up to about a 1,000 years.\n\u0026quot;The last megathrust earthquake originating from the Cascadia subduction zone occurred in 1700 AD. Therefore, we are now in the risk zone of another earthquake. Even though it could be tomorrow or perhaps even centuries before it occurs, paleoseismic studies such as this one can help us understand the nature and frequency of rupture along the Cascadia Subduction Zone, and help Canadian coastal communities to improve their hazard assessments and emergency preparedness plans.\u0026quot;\n\u0026quot;This exceptionally well-dated paleoseismic study by Enkin et al., involved a multi-disciplinary team of Canadian university and federal government scientists, and a core from the 2002 international drill program Marges Ouest Nord Américaines (MONA) campaign,\u0026quot; says Dr. Olav Lian, an associate editor of the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, professor at the University of the Fraser Valley and Director of the university's Luminescence Dating Laboratory. \u0026quot;It gives us our first glimpse back in geologic time, of the recurrence interval of large and megathrust earthquakes impacting the vulnerable BC outer coastline. It also supports paleoseismic data found in offshore marine sediment cores along the US portion of the Cascadia Subduction Zone, recently released in an important United States Geological Survey (USGS) paleoseismic study by a team of researchers led by Dr. Chris Goldfinger of Oregon State University. In addition to analyzing the Effingham Inlet record for earthquake events, this study site has also revealed much information about climate and ocean changes throughout the Holocene to the present. These findings also clearly illustrate the importance of analyzing the geologic record to help today's planners and policy makers, and ultimately to increase the resiliency of Canadian communities.\u0026quot;\n\u0026#160;\nFigure 6 from the report: Major Cascadia earthquakes have occurred on a regular basis as shown by these studies at a variety of different locations.

  "content":"The Vashon Maury Island Radio Club and VashonBePrepared invites the public to visit Vashon’s amateur radio volunteers at our 2013 Field Day event. Vashon Hams gather at Sunrise Ridge on June 22 \u0026amp; 23 for Field Day’s 80th anniversary to compete in the largest single amateur radio and emergency preparedness exercise, with over 35,000 operators participating throughout the US \u0026amp; Canada.\nLocal ham volunteers who donate their valuable services to the community invites the general public to explore the fascinating world of amateur radio and even try making a call yourself! This is a family friendly event and youth are especially welcome to explore our Communications trailer and learn about the various digital equipment and send out a radio transmission – whether voice, video or email – directly to a remote location without any wires!\nVashon’s Field Day Specifics\nEvent Date: Saturday, June 22, 11 AM through Sunday, June 23rd, 11 AM\nLocation: Sunrise Ridge, SW 210th St, behind Vashon Health Center \u0026amp; the ball fields near Voice of Vashon and the Food Bank.\nVashon Maury Island Radio Club\nThe Vashon Maury Island Radio Club (VMIRC, with call sign W7VMI) is an unusually vital 501(c)(3) organization. Open to the public, with no membership dues, the club:\nsupports King County Fire District 13, Office of Emergency Management and Sheriff’s Department during emergencies including several recent search and rescue operations, provides leadership in the VashonBePrepared coalition of disaster preparedness organizations, networks with regional and state Emergency Operations Centers during monthly radio exercises, actively trains with VashonBePrepared’s EOC Team, drills with Vashon’s Citizen Emergency Response Team (CERT), provides radio support for Vashon’s Medical Reserve Corps (MRC), holds regular educational classes and certification exams,\u0026#160; maintains local radio repeaters for the public’s use, participates in local and international radio contests, maintains a mobile communications trailer, conducts multiple radio practice sessions (‘nets’) for local hams each week, has weekly breakfast meetings, runs a busy email list, conducts quarterly equipment demonstrations, maintains their www.vmirc.org web site, and offers the annual Field Day to further encourage public involvement Emergency Preparedness\nVMIRC’s emergency preparedness activities are conducted through the club’s Amateur Radio Emergency Service® (ARES) affiliation. ARES consists of licensed amateurs who voluntarily register their qualifications and equipment for public communications duty when disaster strikes. Internet, traditional and cell phones, email and other forms of modern communications are periodically disrupted – and often during emergencies. Amateur Radio provides the only consistent, decentralized and resilient communications backup for communities.\nARES chief, John Galus says, “Vashon’s ARES team has been involved in significantly more live activations this past year. Our frequent drills with Vashon Island Fire \u0026amp; Rescue, CERT, MRC and VashonBePrepared has really improved our effectiveness and ability to efficiently respond to actual incidents. Communications help keep crises from becoming disasters.”\n2013 Field Day\nPhoto from 2011 Vashon Field Day\nOn Saturday and Sunday June 22nd and 23rd, VMIRC competes in ARRL’s Field Day event with thousands of amateur radio operators making radio contacts from community parks, campgrounds, schools and emergency centers throughout North America. Open to the public, this is a great way for those curious about radio communications to see real operations, chat with operators and even try a call themselves. VMIRC President Sharon Danielson says, “We are delighted at the influx of new radio operators over the past year. Numerous mothers and fathers concerned with emergency family communications and other civic minded volunteer have taken trainings and joined our club in the past year.\u0026#160; With new radios available for $50, there are fewer barriers to new operators than ever before. Plus we’ve a great social group!”\nPoints are awarded for a wide variety of activities under simulated emergency conditions:\nencouraging alternative \u0026amp; emergency power sources such as batteries and solar arrays, mobile operation of radios and antennas, operation of a wide range of modes (e.g., voice, historical Morse code, digital email and video sent via radio), continuous 24 hour availability, ability to reach other contestants across the globe, visits by elected officials, and involvement of youth and the public who have never tried radio operation before. \u0026#160;\nVashon’s Field Day Coordinator, Georgia Galus said, “The public is invited to see what ham radio is all about and have a chance to try their hand at making radio contacts and experience the fun of operating an amateur radio station.\u0026#160; This is a chance to meet and talk with Vashon’s radio operators and see what modern Amateur Radio Emergency Service is all about.\u0026#160; During the two day event we will have demonstrations of satellite communications, a digital communications workshop and an opportunity to learn how to get your own FCC radio license before the next disaster strikes. We’ll also be using the club’s brand new second transmitter. It provides exciting new digital modes and technical capabilities to the community.”\nThe staging area for the Vashon ham radio event is provided by Sunrise Ridge and is located in a large grass field at the extreme west end of the campus – past the ball fields and Voice of Vashon.\u0026#160; On-Air operations start at 11 AM Saturday they will continue until 11 AM Sunday.\nFor more information about preparedness and amateur radio – please visit:\n\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; Vashon Maury Island Radio Club:\u0026#160; www.vmirc.org\n\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; VashonBePrepared: www.VashonBePrepared.org\n\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; Vashon Island Fire \u0026amp; Rescue: www.vifr.org\n\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; King County Office of Emergency Management: www.kingcounty.gov/safety/prepare.aspx\n\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; ARRL the national association for Amateur Radio:\u0026#160; www.arrl.org/field-day\n"},{

Please join and share this opportunity with other individuals and organizations who might be interested. See details below and in the attachment.\nWebinar Description Nonstructural components of buildings include all elements that are not part of the structural system; that is, the architectural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems, as well as furniture, fixtures, equipment, and other contents. During the recent earthquakes in Chile, New Zealand, Japan, Virginia and other earlier earthquakes in California, Washington, and other parts of the U.S., nonstructural failures have accounted for the majority of damage and injuries. In many cases, businesses, schools, hospitals, and other organizations had to spend excessive time and dollars for clean up and repair due to nonstructural failures; therefore impeding continued operations and rapid recovery. Moreover, nonstructural component failures also impeded safe evacuation, delayed rescue, and caused additional hazards such as fire resulting in serious life safety issues.\nThis FEMA-sponsored 1 ½ hour webinar describes the sources and types of nonstructural earthquake damage and the effective methods and guidance that individuals and organizations can use to take action now before the next earthquake and minimize future injuries and property losses from nonstructural risks.\nTarget Audience Property owners, facility managers, local officials, engineers, architects, small businesses, and emergency managers.\nRecommended Prerequisite\nIS-325—Earthquake Basics: Science, Risk, and Mitigation A 30 minute independent study course that provides basic information on earthquake, its impacts, and general mitigation techniques.

More info about the underlying Volunteer Firefighter effort is at www.JustBeThere.info According to Washington Fire Chiefs Association - who got the grant to do the production:\nDid you know that nearly 75% of all firefighters in the United States are volunteers? In the State of Washington, we have a volunteer firefighter staffing problem, in both recruiting and retention. Overall, we have not recruited volunteers rapidly enough to keep pace with attrition. It is estimated that we recruit approximately 3900 new volunteers each year although that number continues to decline, and in recent years, we are losing about 3700 per year. Further, in Washington State, we are governed by a standard (NFPA 1720) that indicates the state actually needs 9000 more responders to provide adequate coverage and meet stated response times. If you are interested in being involved with Washington volunteer opportunities in your local fire service you can call 1-800-FIRELINE or go to http://www.justbethere.info/volunteer to be connected with a fire department in your area.\n"},{

  "content":" The Main Himalayan Thrust has historically been responsible for a magnitude 8 to 9 earthquake every several hundred years. (Illustration: Warren Caldwell) Will a megathrust earthquake strike the NW in 2013? New Years brings out speculators, and this time it is the Seattle PI, which quotes the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network’s director John Vidale and Stanford University geophysics professor Paul Segall whose studies indicate some potential links between \u0026quot;episodic tremor and slip,\u0026quot;or ETS activity and subsequent quakes. According to the Stanford release:\nThe Cascadia subduction zone, which stretches from northern California to Vancouver Island, has not experienced a major seismic event since it ruptured in 1700, an 8.7–9.2 magnitude earthquake that shook the region and created a tsunami that reached Japan. And while many geophysicists believe the fault is due for a similar scale event, the relative lack of any earthquake data in the Pacific Northwest makes it difficult to predict how ground motion from a future event would propagate in the Cascadia area, which runs through Seattle, Portland and Vancouver. ... An important application of the work will be to help inform new construction how best to mitigate damage should a large earthquake strike.\nMore info: www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Will-a-megathrust-earthquake-strike-the-NW-in-4162559.php http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2012/pr-AGU-earthquakes-northwest.html "},{

Although the quakes would likely be relatively small – they would be large enough to destroy the equipment used to pump the greenhouse gases down.

  "content":" Drill includes delivering critical supplies to Vashon Island by boat\nKing County joined with federal, state, and local agencies this week to test its capacity to respond to and recover from a major earthquake. The exercise, dubbed \u0026ldquo;Evergreen Quake 2012,\u0026rdquo; gave participants a chance to assess their disaster response plans and emergency communication strategies. Six counties, including King County, participated in the drill, along with the state of Washington, more than 20 cities, several tribal nations, and numerous private sector partners. The exercise also included an international component as representatives from the Canadian province of British Columbia took part in the exercise.\n\u0026ldquo;Exercises like this, where we simulate pushing our emergency systems to their limits, keep us ready to respond to a real, crippling quake \u0026ndash; the kind for which we know we\u0026rsquo;re long overdue in this region,\u0026rdquo; said King County Executive Dow Constantine, who would oversee the County\u0026rsquo;s response in the event of disaster.\nThe role of the King County Office of Emergency Management is to coordinate and support the regional disaster response. In one example from the Evergreen Quake 2012 exercise this week, King County supported Vashon Island in testing \u0026ldquo;Operation Lifeline,\u0026rdquo; a plan which uses boats to transport emergency food, medicine, fuel, and medical care to the island during a catastrophic event. As part of the exercise, the King County Water Taxi was put to task loading, transporting, and unloading emergency supplies and critically injured \u0026ldquo;patients.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A 7.1 magnitude quake along the Tacoma Fault would create a humanitarian crisis for Vashon Island\u0026rsquo;s 10,000 residents,\u0026rdquo; said Fire District Chief Hank Lipe. \u0026ldquo;The island is likely to become isolated due to a collapse of critical infrastructure. So, having a well-thought out and tested plan for transporting basic necessities is critical to our community\u0026rsquo;s survival until ferry service can be restored.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;The plans in place for delivering important resources when usual routes have been compromised proved to work well during our drill,\u0026rdquo; stated Ron Panzero of the King County Department of Transportation. \u0026ldquo;This exercise included just one passenger boat, but it allowed us to go through the motions required for establishing a marine transportation link if we ever need to fully activate the Operation Lifeline plan.\u0026rdquo;\nThis the first time Puget Sound emergency agencies have partnered on a marine transportation system to support an isolated island. Partners expect this exercise to yield a model for other islands in the region. While Operation Lifeline can\u0026rsquo;t replace the 70-plus ferry runs that land on Vashon each day, it can bring Islanders basic relief until ferry service is restored.\nWhile public and private sector entities drill their emergency plans, it is also important for residents to make sure they are personally prepared to survive a disaster. Emergency management personnel throughout the region urge citizens to take emergency planning seriously and prepare their households to be self-sufficient for a minimum of three days for minor inconveniences, and for several weeks following a catastrophic event. Tips for personal preparedness can be found at www.kingcounty.gov/prepare. This week\u0026rsquo;s exercise was just the first of a three-part series this summer. Next week, the region will conduct Part 2 of Evergreen Quake 2012 during a logistics exercise to validate the combined local, state, and federal capacity to manage relief supplies after a major disaster. The series concludes in August with a recovery exercise. That event will evaluate short-term recovery issues, including temporary housing, debris removal, individual and family assistance and return of business; as well as address long-term issues, such as community restoration, economic revitalization, and reconstruction of critical infrastructure.\nThe Evergreen Quake Exercise Series is funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for exercise design; the National Emergency Managers Association (NEMA) for exercise support; and many in-kind contributions by participating local, tribal, state, and federal agencies.\n# # #\nNOTE: Raw video from \u0026ldquo;Operation Lifeline\u0026rdquo; on Vashon Island is available upon request. An edited version\u0026nbsp;should be available in a few weeks. Credit for all outdoor photos and video are due James Culbertson: www.jamesculbertson.com.

Read the Evergreen Quake Overview (PDF) for additional information.\nEQES 2012 Executive Overview (PPT)\nOur huge thanks go to Rick Wallace in representing VashonBePrepared not only at the county level but also the state level for his months of effort in this effort.\nI’m not sure if it is ironic or sad, but without such drills, we would not have had an opportunity to actually test out Operation Lifeline – getting a passenger ferry or barge to serve the island’s needs until the regular ferry service might resume. Without the drill, we might not have a phone list of all key contacts in the region – much less the personal relationships that really help in a disaster - once regular channels of business are disrupted. By preparing for a drill we get so much done that would also need to be done for a true disaster. The three exercises in the EQES series are: • Functional Exercise (June 5-6, 2012) • Logistics Exercise (June 12-14, 2012) • Recovery Tabletop Exercise (August 8 \u0026amp; 22, 2012)\nHave a great exercise everyone tomorrow!\n"},{

Despite progress, a series of major ongoing gaps in preparedness remain: basic infrastructure and funding, biosurveillance, maintaining an adequate and expertly trained workforce, developing and manufacturing vaccines and medicines, surge capacity for providing care in major emergencies and helping communities cope with and recover from emergencies.\nThe report also looked at findings from a recently released report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) based on activities in 2007-08 that focus on emergency operations and food outbreak identification.\nOnly two states reported that pre-identified staff were not able to acknowledge notification of emergency exercises or incidents within 60 minutes a minimum of two times, the target established by the CDC; Six states did not activate their emergency operations center (EOC) a minimum of two times, the target established by the CDC; Only two states did not develop at least two After Action Report/Improvement Plans (AAR/IPs) after exercises or real incidents in 2007-08; and 21 states were not able to rapidly identify disease-causing E.coli O157:H7 and submit the lab results in 90 percent of cases within four days.

  "content":"Today, FEMA and its partners released the National Preparedness Report (NPR). The Report identifies significant progress the nation has made in areas of prevention, protection, mitigation, response, and recovery.\u0026#160; Overall the Report found that the nation has increased its collective preparedness, not only from external threats, but also for natural and technological hazards that face its communities. The Report was developed to meet the requirements of Presidential Policy Directive 8/PPD-8: National Preparedness. PPD-8 is aimed at strengthening the security and resilience of the United States through systematic preparation for the threats that pose the greatest risk to the security of the Nation, including acts of terrorism, cyber attacks, pandemics, and catastrophic natural disasters.\nThe NPR focuses on five mission areas: Prevention, Protection, Mitigation, Response and Recovery, as outlined in the National Preparedness Goal released in October 2011.\u0026#160; Within these mission areas are 31 core capabilities central to preparedness. The NPR assesses each of these 31 core capabilities.\nOverall, the NPR found the Nation has made significant progress in enhancing preparedness and identifies several significant areas of national strength. For example, the Nation has built the foundation for an integrated, all-hazards planning architecture that considers routine emergencies and catastrophic events. Operational coordination has also improved with the adoption of the National Incident Management System (NIMS), which provides a common doctrine for incident management. In addition, intelligence and information sharing capabilities are stronger thanks to a national network of fusion centers and Joint Terrorism Task Forces that bring together federal, state, and local law enforcement, Intelligence Community resources, and other public safety officials and private sector partners. The Report also identified opportunities for national improvement in cybersecurity, long-term recovery, and integrating individuals with access and functional needs into preparedness activities.\nFEMA developed the NPR in close coordination with leaders of federal departments and agencies, and the Report reflects inputs from state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, private and nonprofit sector partners, and the general public. Data was also integrated from the 2011 State Preparedness Reports, which are state-wide self-assessments of the core capabilities submitted by all 56 U.S. states and territories through a standard survey.\u0026#160; FEMA also conducted research to identify any recent, independent evaluations, surveys and other data related to the core capabilities.\nThe National Preparedness Report is the next step in implementing PPD-8.\u0026#160; Since the directive was signed by the President in March 2011, FEMA and its partners have released the first edition of the National Preparedness Goal, the National Preparedness System description, and the working drafts of the National Planning Frameworks.

A workshop on the Pacific Northwest Portion of this was held locally on March 21-22, 2012.\nOf the sources of earthquakes they presented the following overall probabilities for Seattle:\n\u0026bull;Cascadia M9: 10-14% \u0026bull;Seattle Fault M 6.5: 5% (from slip rate, GR model; 1000 yr return time) ??? \u0026bull;Deep M 6.5: 84% (from 1949, 1965, 2001) \u0026bull;Random shallow M 6.5 in entire Puget Sound area: 15% (mostly from rate of M 4 since 1963, b=0.8)\nVashon still figures high in the relative PGA maps:\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\nOne critical change in upcoming scenic maps will be the inclusion of the fairly newly identified Tacoma fault \u0026ndash; the one that runs through southern Vashon island.\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\nAccording to KIRO news coverage of the presentation, the USGS scientists warned of an \u0026ldquo;84 percent chance a 6.5 magnitude \u0026lsquo;deep\u0026rsquo; earthquake will strike again in the next 50 years\u0026rdquo;. That's nearly the same size as the 6.8 Nisqually Quake 11 years ago, and other quakes in Puget Sound area in 1965 and 1949.\u0026nbsp; They also warned of a 10-14 percent chance of a magnitude 9 quake on the Cascadia Fault off the Washington and Oregon coastline, and a 5 percent chance of a 6.5 or larger quake on the Seattle Fault.\nWest Seattle Be Prepared, our overseas sister organization got some prime footage in that KIRO video report where the USGS's Art Frankel was also quoted as saying that the Tacoma Fault does not have a high likelihood of releasing in the next 50 years. Still we seem to figure high on the overall shake maps in the past decade. Next Wednesday's talk by state experts should prove illuminating!\n"},{

  "content":" VashonBePrepared is celebrating our 5th anniversary by sponsoring two of the state's foremost experts on Vashon's unique earthquake and tsunami risks. Recent scientific reports, a number based on lessons from Japan's devastating Tōhoku earthquake just a year ago, have all updated our understanding of the damage that will hit our region sometime in the coming decades or centuries. The only question is when - not if - it will occur. Fortunately these experts can help homeowners and families understand what each of us can do to protect ourselves, families, pets, livestock, businesses and property from these predicted disasters. A large portion of the evening will be set aside to get your questions answered. Handouts for families, home and business owners will also be available.\nTimothy J. Walsh is the Chief Hazard Geologist for the Department of Natural Resources within the Division of Geology and Earth Resources at the Washington Geological Survey.\nTim Walsh is a licensed engineering geologist and Geologic Hazards Program manager for the Washington Division of Geology and Earth Resources of the Department of Natural Resources. He has practiced geology in Washington for more than 30 years and taught at South Puget Sound Community College for 25 years.

Since March 1998 SHIPS has conducted a series of seismic studies to better describe earthquake hazards in the Puget Lowland and British Columbia. SHIPS has provided a region wide seismic velocity model, mapped basin geometry, imaged the subsurface geometry of crustal faults including the Tacoma fault zone, and imaged the subducting Juan de Fuca plate beneath the Puget Lowland.\nTheir major findings are especially pertinent for Vashon residents as it looks at local seismic studies for the Seattle Uplift \u0026ndash; which uncovered the Tacoma Fault and shows Vashon being sandwiched by the Seattle and Tacoma fault.

  "content":" Most folks think of an overseas or Cascadia based quake as generating a terrible tsunami \u0026ndash; and they are right. However such a tsunami is not likely to cause massive damage to Vashon from what I\u0026rsquo;ve heard \u0026ndash; largely due to the moderating influence of the Straits of Juan de Fuca. (It will be interesting to verify this at our upcoming April 18th community meeting with Washington State experts). There are some other sources of significant tsunami risks for Vashon however. The main ones are thought to be underwater landslides displacing huge volumes of water after earthquakes along the Seattle or Tacoma faults - which run a couple miles north of Vashon and through lower Vashon respectively.\n\u0026nbsp;\nPuget Sound Tsunami Sources\u0026mdash;2002 Workshop Report; A contribution to the Inundation Mapping Project of the U.S. National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program A great overview of potential tsunami impact on Puget Sound is the NOAA OAR Special Report, Puget Sound Tsunami Sources\u0026mdash;2002 Workshop Report; A contribution to the Inundation Mapping Project of the U.S. National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program. A Joint Special Report, this was published in June 2003 and was sponsored by:\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration United States Geological Survey Washington State Department of Natural Resources Washington State Military Department Emergency Management Division These graphics, from this report highlight that we are in an area with significant and periodic tsunami risks.\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\nWashington, Tsunami Hazard Mapping Project: Modeling Tsunami Inundation From Tacoma And Seattle Fault Earthquakes The most specific study on Vashon-Maury specific impacts that I\u0026rsquo;ve seen is NOAA Technical Memorandum OAR PMEL-132, Tacoma, Washington, Tsunami Hazard Mapping Project: Modeling Tsunami Inundation From Tacoma And Seattle Fault Earthquakes, published in January 2007. The publisher, our local Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, has a variety of sources for further exploration into this topic.\nSome Vashon specific information \u0026ndash; which I\u0026rsquo;ve taken out of context (and added my own emphasis) includes the following:\nSeattle Fault Scenario The southern wave front splits into two upon striking the northern tip of Vashon Island 4 min after initial deformation. The eastern and more intense front travels down East Passage striking northern Maury Island and Dumas Bay and then reflecting off the Ruston Way waterfront and southern Vashon Island 12 min after generation (Fig. 7). The weaker west front travels down Colvos Passage striking Point Defiance before joining with the stronger reflected wave in Dalco Pass. Maximum wave crests of approximately 3.5 m amplitudes reach Commencement Bay and Gig Harbor approximately 19 min after generation (Fig. 6). Part of the primary front\u0026rsquo;s reflected wave energy travels north into Quartermaster Harbor and back up East Passage toward Elliott Bay and northern Puget Sound. The remaining wave energy travels into The Narrows and then dissipates in southern Puget Sound. Smaller though still significant waves continue to reflect back and forth within the study region for 3 hr.\nHigh (\u0026gt;1.5 m/s) wave velocities occur within Commencement Bay, Gig Harbor, East Passage, Quartermaster Harbor, The Narrows, and Wollochet Bay. Since the model does not dynamically include tidal currents, the current speeds may be more substantial if these events occurred during a flood tide.\n- from Page 10\nTacoma Fault Scenario Inundation occurs at both State ferry terminals approximately 18 min after tsunami generation. The Tahlequah terminal at the southern point of Vashon Island is hit with an initial 3.3-m wave with speeds ranging from 5\u0026ndash;7 m/s and overtopping the dock and staging area. A 3.9-m wave strikes the Point Defiance terminal and marina at speeds of approximately 3 m/s\n- from Page 12\nAdditional Scientific Information \u0026nbsp;\n6 minutes after a Seattle Fault Quake 26 Minutes Later\u0026hellip; 43 Minutes Later\u0026hellip; Color indicates the water\u0026rsquo;s height \u0026ndash; in Meters The above graphics from PMEL, show Vashon shorelines could get ~4 meter surges of water above the current tide levels and as much as ~4 meter drops too. It appears worst for Vashon\u0026rsquo;s inner and outer Quartermaster harbor, but certainly appears to me as potentially strong enough to breach the 100 year old isthmus between Vashon and Maury Island. Recall that these are not just temporary waves, but large masses of water with much greater mass and potential for damage.\nhttp://nctr.pmel.noaa.gov/state/wa/index.html and http://nthmp.tsunami.gov/publications.html has more related info.\nhttp://nctr.pmel.noaa.gov/animate.html has a few good movies of this, especially http://nctr.pmel.noaa.gov/Mov/seattle_png.mov (despite being labeled \u0026ldquo;Tacoma Inundation [6.1 MB file, .mov]\u0026rdquo;) which shows over 4M surges!\nStill more information may become available in the coming months from the new HAZUS runs being done by FEMA for the Vashon region.\n"},{

  "content":" In \u0026ldquo;Quake catastrophe like Japan's could hit Pacific Northwest, new data show\u0026rdquo; M. Alex Johnson of msnbc.com also reports on last month\u0026rsquo;s reports at the American Association for the Advancement of Science \u0026ndash; noting that the Cascadia quake has numerous parallels with Japan\u0026rsquo;s Tōhoku disaster one year ago.\nAt that conference, the University of Nevada-Reno\u0026rsquo;s John Anderson, said that the Cascadia fault line poses the greater threat of unleashing a killer mega-quake than the San Andreas fault running through California. Based on analysis of last year\u0026rsquo;s quake, researchers say a Cascadia event, if deep, could result in more damaging shacking than what happened in Japan.\nAccording to the msnbc story,\nThe warnings come as the White House is proposing a 2013 budget that would cut $4.6 million from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's tsunami programs. Much of that would come from the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program, which funds evacuation maps, training and education efforts \u0026mdash; important services given how deeply the Japanese quake and tsunami transformed the science of seismology.\nIn another MSNBC story, California\u0026rsquo;s Earthquake Early Warning network or ShakeAlert \u0026ndash; once refined - could provide maybe 30 seconds advance warning of a quake, but funding for the $80 million required for the southern system is very uncertain \u0026ndash; much less the $70 million for a northwest early warning earthquake network.\n"},{

CallBook (Author: Dog Park Software, Cost: $1.99) Simple ham radio callbook lookup that accesses the WM7D database (or QRZ and Ham Call databases if you are a subscriber).\nMaidenhead Converter (Author: Donald Hays, Cost: Free) Handy app that displays your grid locator, uses maps and does lat/lon to grid locator conversions.\nQ Codes Reference (Author: fiddlemeragged, Cost: Free) This app displays the definition of the common Q Signals (QRZ, QSL, QTH, …)\nUTC Time (Author: Michael Wells, Cost: Free) A simple app that displays UTC time and local time.\nSunspot (Author: Jeff Smith, Cost: Free) A simple app that displays solar data from WWV.\nHam I Am (Author: Storke Brothers, Cost: Free) A handy app that covers some basic amateur radio reference material (Phonetic alphabet, Q Signals, Ham Jargon, Morse Code, RST System, etc.) Although I find the name to be silly, I like the app!\nThere are a few repeater directory apps out there:\nQSL.FM Mobile (Author: Robert Abraham, Cost: $2.99) Geolocation repeater directory and call sign lookup.\niHAM Repeater Database (Author: Garry Gerossie, Cost: $4.99) Geolocation repeater directory. This seems to work a lot better than the QSL.FM app.\nIf you are an EchoLink user, then you’ll want this app:\nEchoLink (Author: Synergenics, Cost: Free) The EchoLink app for the iPhone.\nThere are quite a few APRS apps out there. I have tried these:\niBCNU (Author: Luceon, Cost: $1.99) The first APRS app I was able to get running. It just turned on and worked. It integrates the aprs.fi mapping into the app, so it is easy to use. I recommend this one for most casual APRS users.\nOpenAPRS (Author: Gregory Carter, Cost: $3.99) This APRS app integrates into the openaprs.net server. A bit more complicated to set up but looks to be more flexible, too. You might want to check out openaprs.net before buying this app.\nPocketPacket (Author: Koomasi, Cost: $4.99) another APRS app. Seems to work fine but I find the previous 2 apps more useful. Note: This app can function as a packet modem connected to a transceiver (no internet required).\nHam Tracker (Author: Kram, Cost: $2.99) APRS app, works OK, uses external maps such as Google and aprs.fi. “Share” feature allows you to send an SMS or email with your location information.\nSatellite tracking is another useful app for a smartphone:\nISS Lite (Author: Craig Vosburgh, Cost: Free) A free satellite tracking app for just the International Space Station\nProSat Satellite Tracker (Author: Craig Vosburgh, Cost: $9.99) This app is by the same author as ISS Lite, but is the full-featured “pro” version.

  "content":"Reducing the Risks of Nonstructural Earthquake Damage—A Practical Guide, Fourth Edition (FEMA E-74) Course Description Nonstructural components of buildings include all elements that are not part of the structural system; that is, the architectural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems, as well as furniture, fixtures, equipment, and other contents. During the recent earthquakes in Chile, New Zealand, Japan, Virginia and other earlier earthquakes in California, Washington, and other parts of the U.S., nonstructural failures have accounted for the majority of damage and injuries. In many cases, businesses, schools, hospitals, and other organizations had to spend excessive time and dollars for clean up and repair due to nonstructural failures; therefore impeding continued operations and rapid recovery. Moreover, nonstructural component failures also impeded safe evacuation, delayed rescue, and caused additional hazards such as fire resulting in serious life safety issues.\nThis FEMA-sponsored 1 ½ hour free webinar describes the sources and types of nonstructural earthquake damage and the effective methods and guidance that individuals and organizations can use to take action now before the next earthquake and minimize future injuries and property losses from nonstructural risks.\nTarget Audience Building owners, facility managers, local officials, engineers, architects, small businesses, and emergency managers in the Pacific Northwest.\nWebinar Information Time: 1:00 pm – 2:30 pm PST\nDate: Tuesday, February 14, 2012\nWebinar Link: https://fema.connectsolutions.com/nehrp-webinar/ If you have never used Adobe Connect Pro before, please test your connection prior to joining the webinar: https://fema.connectsolutions.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm.\nAudio: Dial 1 (888) 387-8686, Conference ID: 5416036 Audio lines are limited to 300 participants only.

  "content":"A new National Center on Atmospheric Research (NCAR) web site titled “Weather on Steroids” explores the connection between all the unusual weather and climate change. Getting a handle on the true changes due to global warming requires massive statistical and scientific analyses.\nThe NCAR site delves into topics such as “Extreme weather forensics”, are we “Doping the atmosphere”, “Is this Climate Change?”, “Risky Business” and many more.\nThe United States endured a record 14 disasters in 2011 that each inflicted at least $1 billion in damage, according to NOAA in their http://www.noaa.gov/extreme2011/ web site on the various disasters last year. Last year saw more such mega-disasters than during all the 1980’s combined.\nExperts note that the evidence can be strong or weak, depending on the type of weather. Researchers admit there are no clear answers. \u0026quot;This is a very complicated subject,\u0026quot; said David Hosansky, spokesman for the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, which produced the report and operates the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. \u0026quot;We were convinced that these different messages could confuse the public and leave the people thinking that we just can't connect the dots.

  "content":"\nNow Available for Android Users\nIn an ongoing effort to save lives, About The Kids Foundation today announces the free release of the ICE Standard App for Google Android users. Currently rated “The #1 Most Downloaded Emergency Contact Information App” for Apple iPhone, the ICE Standard App protects users during an emergency by featuring critical information as a screensaver.\nIn the event of an emergency, the ICE Standard App is designed to save lives by providing first time responders with immediate access to critical information about a patient. To help responders quickly identify a person’s condition, the App uses a tricolor system: Green (Good to Go), Yellow (Caution: Medications), and Red (Stop: Special Medical Condition or Life Threatening Allergies). In addition, ICE Standard offers features to display one’s emergency contact information, blood type, medications, allergies, medical history, and power of attorney. The card and App also include a space for users to upload a photo I.D. for emergency identification.\n“The information provided on the ICE Standard App is extremely helpful when in the field. It allows us to get information about the patient quickly and start administering the appropriate care sooner,” commented Robert Amjad, Emergency Medical Technician and Emergency Standard board member.\nJoseph A. Ekman, CEO and Founder of ICE Standard, created The Emergency Standard Card and ICE Standard App after becoming permanently disabled and realizing the need to improve our nation’s emergency standards. “The lack of adequate and easily accessible medical data in critical circumstances is a looming defect in our nation’s medical response system. With The Emergency Standard Card and ICE Standard App, we can better protect ourselves and save lives,” stated Mr. Ekman.\nTo help establish ICE Standard as the official guide to locating a person's medical information, About the Kids Foundation has been reaching out to local emergency response teams and promoting the free ICE Standard App to download, as well as the purchase of The Emergency Standard Card. To download the ICE Standard App on an Apple iPhone, visit the Apple Store at http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ice-standard-the-emergency/id412786820?mt=8\u0026amp;ls=1#.

  "content":" Doomsday clock moves closer to midnight Numerous articles (including USA Today\u0026rsquo;s) note that scientists have moved the hands of the doomsday clock toward midnight \u0026ndash; as a visible metaphor for our lessened security due to our fuelish ways.\u0026nbsp; It is notoriously hard to change our social (i.e., automotive) ways, but the consequences of our not taking a long term view are increasingly resulting in massive storm and economic damage today to societies across the globe. Disaster risks are judged by multiplying the estimated severity of an issue by the likelihood that it might come to pass. Given the huge impacts already visible from messing with the earth\u0026rsquo;s weather and then multiplying that major severity by the global scale of those affected -- it is easy to see that that Climate Change is one of the worst disasters we could ever face \u0026ndash; and it is happening now. That it is comes on slowly, and erratically, does nothing to diminish its impact on us all.\nThe Bulletin of Atomic Scientist\u0026rsquo;s Doomsday Clock represents the danger to society from Nuclear Weapons, Climate Change and Biosecurity.\nClimate Change Fossil-fuel technologies such as coal-burning plants powered the industrial revolution, bringing unparalleled economic prosperity to many parts of the world. But in the 1950s, scientists began measuring year-to-year changes in the carbon-dioxide concentration in the atmosphere that they could relate to fossil-fuel combustion, and they began to see the implications for Earth's temperature and for climate change.\nToday, the concentration of carbon dioxide is higher than at any time during the last 650,000 years. These gases warm Earth's continents and oceans by acting like a giant blanket that keeps the sun's heat from leaving the atmosphere, melting ice and triggering a number of ecological changes that cause an increase in global temperature. Even if carbon-dioxide emissions were to cease immediately, the extra gases already added to the atmosphere, which linger for centuries, would continue to raise sea level and change other characteristics of the Earth for hundreds of years.\nThe most authoritative scientific group on the issue, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), suggests that warming on the order of 2-10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 100 years is a distinct possibility if the industrialized world doesn't curb its carbon dioxide emissions habit. Effects could include wide-ranging, dramatic changes. One drastic result: a 3- to 34-inch rise in sea level, leading to more coastal erosion, increased flooding during storms, and, in some regions such as the Indus River Delta in Bangladesh and the Mississippi River Delta in the United States, permanent inundation. This sea-level rise will affect coastal cities (New York, Miami, Shanghai, London) the most, compelling major shifts in human settlement patterns.\nInland, the IPCC predicts that another century of temperature increases could place severe stress on forests, alpine regions, and other ecosystems, threaten human health as mosquitoes and other disease-carrying insects and rodents spread lethal viruses and bacteria over larger geographical regions, and harm agricultural efforts by reducing rainfall in many food-producing areas while at the same time increasing flooding in others--any of which could contribute to mass migrations and wars over arable land, water, and other natural resources.\n-- from www.thebulletin.org/content/doomsday-clock/overview\n"},{

Many fusion centers and EOCs surveyed do not exchange information.\nWhile Washington State\u0026rsquo;s fusion center\u0026rsquo;s near-daily briefing tends toward being a fear based police blotter, extracting news from the conservative press, it does offer periodic useful news of value to the Vashon disaster preparedness community.

More than 83 percent of the locations visited were either unaware of or did not utilize federal guidance for fusion center and emergency operations center interaction provided in Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 502,\" promulgated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the report added. Both fusion centers and emergency operations centers would benefit from talking to each other as they have similar missions. They each manage the flow of information on the ground in their jurisdictions to the federal government and vice versa, the IG report said. The centers should make it a top priority to form relationships and to work together to exchange information and intelligence on a daily basis to strengthen the safety and security of state and local residents.\nwww.hstoday.us/industry-news/general/single-article/dhs-ig-recommends-fusion-centers-and-emergency-operations-centers-talk-more/05dcfe6a39da4c6b8e98554508c76c25.html "},{

A useful new national program has just been announced that promises to provide some great guidance for all of us. The big aim:\nIdentify your risk Make a mitigation project plan Implement techniques for ensuring and enhancing business resilience What a great new goal for Vashon businesses in 2012! The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) has just released the FEMA P-811 CD:\u0026nbsp; Earthquake Publications for Businesses (QuakeSmart Toolkit).\u0026nbsp; Thousands of earthquakes occur in the United States each year; most are too small to significantly affect businesses and communities. However, large and very damaging earthquakes have occurred in the past and could happen again at anytime.\u0026nbsp; In general, many businesses have invested in emergency management and continuity of operations planning. However, most businesses have not conducted earthquake mitigation measures to protect their assets, staff, and business operations. During an earthquake, buildings\u0026mdash;or their components or contents\u0026mdash;can be collapsed, toppled, broken apart, tossed around, or rendered inoperable or unusable.\nTherefore, as part of addressing all-hazards emergency management, it is critical for businesses to also incorporate actionable earthquake mitigation solutions into their planning and business decisions.\u0026nbsp; By doing so, businesses protect the organization\u0026rsquo;s assets (people, property, operations); sustain the capability to provide goods and/or services to the community; maintain cash flow; preserve competitive advantage and reputation; and provide the ability to meet legal, regulatory, financial and contractual obligations.\nThis QuakeSmart Toolkit (FEMA P-811CD) provides business owners, managers, and employees with basic guidance and ready-to-use tools that can be tailored to the specific needs and requirements of the user. The guidance and tools focus on the importance of earthquake mitigation and the simple things they can do to reduce the potential of earthquake damages, injuries, and financial losses at work\u0026hellip;AND also at home and within their communities.\nThanks to our contributors and subject matter experts for their forthcoming support in developing this QuakeSmart Toolkit!\u0026nbsp; It walks you through the following 3-step QuakeSmart process:\u0026nbsp; How to identify your risk How to make a mitigation project plan How to take action and implement the techniques for ensuring and enhancing business resilience from an earthquake To immediately view or download the QuakeSmart Toolkit (FEMA P-811CD), visit http://www.fema.gov/plan/prevent/earthquake/qstoolkit/index.shtm.\nTo order CD copies of the QuakeSmart Toolkit from the FEMA Publications Warehouse, call (800) 480-2520 or fax your request to (240) 699-0525.\u0026nbsp; To download other FEMA Earthquake guidance and materials, visit http://www.fema.gov/plan/prevent/earthquake/publications.shtm.\nThank you for your continued interest and support.\u0026nbsp; Please feel free to share this message with others.\u0026nbsp; "},{

  "content":" A car accident snapped off the power pole at Dockton and Pt. Robinson roads last night about 6 PM. Unfortunately the accident curiously snapped the pole up about 20 feet high and took out the island\u0026rsquo;s primary electrical power feed. While most of island only experienced a 10 second outage, about 500 PSE customers had a couple hour service interruption. 1200 Maury Island people didn\u0026rsquo;t have power (and Comcast service) fully restored until about 3:30 PM today.\nDuring the event Rick Frye wrote the following note to the Vashon-Maury Island Radio Club\u0026rsquo;s email group, which I thought a great reflection on the event: And while I don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about the particulars in this case, I do know that sometimes \u0026ndash; especially when a pole breaks \u0026ndash; a lower voltage line can come into contact with a higher voltage line and this will cause the lower voltage line to become hyper-energized leading to problems along that line that might wipe out a circuit breaker or two and/or transformers that may need to be replaced.\u0026nbsp; From the sound of things, it seems like there is more than a single thing that is in need of repair.\nBut the silver lining is that some people who have not had to do so recently have had the experience of identifying alternative sources of heat and light and, hopefully, are finding out anew where their own bottle necks are and how to circumnavigate those issues.\u0026nbsp; It\u0026rsquo;s a good reminder to keep some blue ice in our freezers and ensure that our butane stoves and generators are operational, etc.\nFor those of you who are within or near the outage zone, check on your neighbors and if you have a generator and they don\u0026rsquo;t, some serious extension cords and some power for an hour or so can save the contents of their freezer/fridge.\u0026nbsp; It\u0026rsquo;s a good time to reach out and touch any neighbors you don\u0026rsquo;t yet know very well and to reestablish any relationships that may have lost their connection.\nRick, KU\u0026Oslash;W\nThese minor outages certainly do keep us on our toes and serve a very useful reminder to stay prepared!

Although Hazus-MH itself is free, it requires the users to have ArcGIS with ArcView license level.\nExisting HAZUS-MH runs for Vashon (i.e. those for our 2005 Earthquake Study, USGS analysis for their April 2010 fact sheet #3023 , and the recent Evergreen Quake runs) have used older versions of HAZUS and don\u0026rsquo;t incorporate some of the latest geographic data becoming available as part of the Vashon-Maury Island Coastal Flood Hazard Mapping project \u0026ndash; which has resulted in some excellent new very detailed (e.g., 2 foot contours!) maps of Vashon\u0026rsquo;s shoreline.

  "content":" It appears that the ICS Task Books that help evaluators judge ICS performance (2007 versions are online at http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/IS/ICSResource/PositionChecklists.htm) have been newly revised in April 2011, and are now published as a draft docket currently undergoing a comment period as detailed in the October 4th Federal Register. These may be revisions of the original 1993 Wildland Fire evaluation forms that are still on the Department of Labor\u0026rsquo;s OSHA site.\nOSHA\u0026rsquo;s eTools guide to the ICS system is a new find for me and fairly interesting - if a bit dated and lacking in depth.\nSince the new ICS Task Books are written for someone evaluating a person\u0026rsquo;s performance in these positions, I do not see them as very helpful for the person actually performing the job! I continue to search for a basic guide and checklist for ICS personnel, something with some more depth than the OSHA eTool or the existing Job Aids, but in a handy format that could be carried and referenced in the field.\nThe Red Cross has nice spiral bound guides for shelter managers and staff. Why can\u0026rsquo;t ICS staffers have something as practical as the Red Cross\u0026rsquo; Shelter Field Guide \u0026amp; Shelter Manager\u0026rsquo;s Toolkit?!\nCynically, I suspect any usable job guides are locked away at the Emergency Management Institute in Emmitsburg and only available to those with time to take FEMA\u0026rsquo;s courses - but frankly could easily be somewhere on the Internet I\u0026rsquo;ve yet to uncover too. So to me, these newly revised Task Books are most useful as they contain the only detailed listing I\u0026rsquo;ve found of ICS staffer\u0026rsquo;s duties. Unfortunately they still need to be reverse engineered, decrypted, and extracted from these Task Books to be usable by the actual ICS personnel! (Please help me find something more usable if such a thing does exist by adding your comments below.)\nFederal Register Vol. 76, No.192, October 4, 2011 - FEMA has published the Federal Register Notice [TEXT] [PDF] announcing that the \u0026ldquo;All-Hazard Position Task Books for Type 3 Incident Management Teams\u0026rdquo; are available for public review and comment.\u0026nbsp; SUMMARY: The All-Hazard Position Task Books for Type 3 Incident Management Teams were developed to assist personnel achieve qualifications in the All-Hazard ICS positions. The position task books also provide the documentation necessary for agencies and organizations to evaluate their personnel and certify their personnel as qualified to the positions. The position task books supplement the qualification requirements contained in the NIMS Job Titles, which specify any Education, Training, Experience, Physical/Medical Fitness, Currency, and Licensure/Certification for each position. The position task books have been derived from National Wildfire Coordinating Group position task books to leverage their successful experience in managing the qualifications of their personnel.\u0026nbsp; The position task books in this initial group contain:\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; 1.

  "content":" Prepare. Plan. Stay Informed.\n\u0026nbsp;\nThe first ever nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System will occur on Nov 9 at 2 pm ET and last for about 3 minutes, according to Damon Penn, of National Continuity Programs. Though an emergency warning system has been in place in the U.S., in various forms since the 1950s, and is tested in each state on a weekly and monthly basis, there has never been a nationwide test of the system. (EAS and the earlier EBS and CONELRAD systems have yet to be used for an actual Presidential nationwide alert.)\nWhat may sound somewhat routine to individuals (who are used to local tests) will actually be the culmination of years of effort by hundreds of people, new software, infrastructure improvements and a complete system for getting out alerts in a truly modern way.\nFor a bit of the technical background to the new Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS-OPEN) software and the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) infrastructure see my earlier post. CAP is an open, standards interchange format to send or collect data related to all types of emergency warnings. CAP standards facilitate receipt and delivery of local, regional and national level reports to a variety of information-management and warning dissemination systems. MyStateUSA, is used throughout the state and is CAP 1.1 compliant. Vashon should be getting limited MyStateUSA access itself soon! Extensive background info\u0026nbsp;on the EAS Test can be found in the EAS Toolkit.\nWashingtonians should be especially proud since our state\u0026rsquo;s Telecommunications and Warning Systems Manager, Don Miller, KE7UUK, according to this RadioWorld article, has been long involved in a leadership role as co-chair of the State Emergency Communications Committee, as a board member of the Partnership for Public Warning - which developed CAP and promoted its federal adoption. He provided me these slides of the state system, from his National Alliance of State Broadcasters Association webinar earlier this year. He also presented a great EAS to CAP Migration in Washington State webinar. Numerous other IPAWS presentations exist on the FEMA website.\nWhen you listen to the radio or TV on November 9th at 11 AM, you should now appreciate a bit more what\u0026rsquo;s gone into this! As the Federal, State, tribal, territorial and local governments prepare for and test their capabilities, this event serves as a reminder that everyone should establish an emergency preparedness kit and emergency plan for themselves, their families, communities, and businesses.\n"},{

Learning that nationally 40% of businesses do not survive a disaster provided a sober incentive for our local business owners to undertake cost-effective steps to ensure their businesses continuity after storms, earthquakes, or any other disaster.\nJoe Ulatoski met with the Vashon Downtown Merchant\u0026rsquo;s Association at a follow-up meeting and has been busy distilling information from many sources (see below) into a handy 6 page guide for Vashon Businesses which he handed out at this morning\u0026rsquo;s meeting \u0026ndash; shown in some of these photos. According to Debi Richards, only businesses from select neighborhoods were present today \u0026ndash; with additional meetings to be held for businesses from other areas of the island.

Interest in the Vashon 101 course, free CPR and first aid courses from VIFR and the upcoming CERT class (Spring 2012) were all very high.\nMany excellent resources for businesses interested in preparedness exist on the web, including the following:\nKing County's Office of Emergency Management business site: www.kingcounty.gov/safety/prepare/residents_business/BusinessPreparedness.aspx Washington State Emergency Management Department's business site: www.emd.wa.gov/preparedness/prep_business.shtml Federal Emergency Management Agency's business site: www.ready.gov/business/index.html Formation of Vashon\u0026rsquo;s Business NERO (Business Neighborhood Emergency Response Organization)\u0026nbsp;program has been one of the most exciting developments this year, and VashonBePrepared is delighted to have the Chamber\u0026rsquo;s vitality directed at this critical function.\n"},{

  "content":" The residents of Vashon and all the volunteers and organizations under the VashonBePrepared banner were honored Friday, September 30th by King County Executive Dow Constantine and King County Councilmember Joe McDermott - the final day of National Preparedness Month. As described by the actual 2011 King County Executive Award for Community Preparedness, and by the official King County press release, the award was to the entire community and emphasized the many contributors to Vashon\u0026rsquo;s preparedness. The Carnation-Duvall Citizen Corps Council was likewise lauded with a similar award.\nFormally accepting the 2011 King County Executive Award for Community Preparedness from Dow Constantine and Joe McDermott were VashonBePrepared President John Cornelison and VIFR Fire Chief Hank Lipe.\n\u0026ldquo;Vashon residents and business share an ethic of preparedness, but it is wonderful that everyone\u0026rsquo;s hard efforts can be recognized. Hopefully this can inspire others \u0026ndash; on and off our island \u0026ndash; to also prepare for the inevitable storms and earthquakes ahead,\u0026rdquo; according to John Cornelison.\nConstantine and State Senator (elect) Sharon Nelson had come over to Vashon last fall at the height of the \u0026ldquo;Gizzard Blizzard\u0026rdquo; and were impressed with what they saw \u0026ndash; a team of volunteers working alongside professionals. Dow Constantine \u0026amp; Joe McDermott noted this, but also the ongoing work over the years by all of Vashon\u0026rsquo;s residents and the numerous organizations striving for preparedness \u0026ndash; working closely with Washington State and King County, especially through King County\u0026rsquo;s Office Of Emergency Management.\nParticipating in the awards ceremony (from the left in this photo) were: Joe Ulatoski (NERO), Al Francisco (ARES), King County Executive Dow Constantine, Patricia McClements (PSE), Rex Stratton (VIFR), Catherine Rogers (VEPC), Jill Janow (PI), John Galus (ARES), Fire Chief Hank Lipe (VIFR), John Cornelison (VashonBePrepared), Synthia Downs (MRC), Michael Cochrane (CERT), Catherine Cochrane (CERT), King County Councilmember Joe McDermott. At least six of those have amateur radio licensees. Numerous other volunteers were not able to attend.\nVashonBePrepared is a coalition of disaster preparedness organizations on Vashon-Maury Island in Washington's Puget Sound region. Under the umbrella of VashonBePrepared and operating under the auspices of Vashon Island Fire and Rescue and King County\u0026rsquo;s Office of Emergency Management, continued emphasis has been placed on individual and community preparedness:\nA functioning Emergency Operations Center (EOC) has been established, The Vashon Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) organization trained in excess of 200 islanders in minor firefighting, first aid, search and rescue and communication; Vashon Radio Club (an ARES affiliate) organized a parallel emergency communications network; The Medical Reserve Corps set up an emergency response structure to augment existing medical personnel and facilities; Over 100 informal Neighborhood Emergency Response Organizations (NERO's) have been activated and businesses are now organizing; Voice of Vashon (VoV) established an island wide emergency public information radio network; The Vashon Emergency Preparedness Committee (VEPC) continues the process of expanding plans for shelter and feeding of personnel in the aftermath of a disaster. VashonBePrepared helps recruit, train and coordinate volunteers, works closely with Vashon Island Fire \u0026amp; Rescue (VIFR) to mitigate effects of disasters, and educates the public and local businesses on how to best prepare for disruptive events. Over 3% of island residents have volunteered with VashonBePrepared at one time or another and an unusually high percentage of islanders have lain in supplies. Maintaining this level of preparedness is a key challenge. Winter storms regularly knock out power for days and \u0026ndash; along with periodic ferry outages \u0026ndash; help residents maintain their alertness. Vashon residents are also aware of earthquake potential from Seattle and Tacoma Faults that lie near and under our island.\nAfterward VashonBePrepared\u0026rsquo;s Joe Ulatoski (father of Vashon\u0026rsquo;s disaster preparedness efforts) and John Cornelison were interviewed by KPCQ, Seattle Channel 13 TV, who were curious how other communities could learn from our successes.\nAccording to Joe Ulatoski, \u0026ldquo;1) Create a family communications plan. Everyone should know who \u0026ndash; outside the Puget Sound Region \u0026ndash; they can call. 2) Communicate with your neighbors who will be your first source of help after an event.\n3) Store food, water and other basic supplies\u0026nbsp; - enough for 10 days! See www.VashonBePrepared.org for checklists and other advice.\"\n"},{

  "content":"According to 1st Alert, 79% of families have a fire escape plan, but 51% have never practiced it, and 29% have only done so once. The National Fire Protection Association recommends practicing your emergency escape routes twice annually. Other fire safety organizations promote monthly drills – as a way to bolster reaction times during a real emergency.\nThis likely should also hold for other preparedness plans for Vashon families – and businesses.\nA Red Cross recent survey shows that 80% of Americans had taken at least one key preparedness step, such as: • 47% assembled emergency kit • 45% chosen out of town contact • 24% practiced emergency plan But only 12% of Americans are reasonably prepared for a disaster, as recommended by the Red Cross.\n"},{

The new system is actually located inside the fire station and so has a trickle charger that will keep the batteries topped off.\nWhen volunteers at Voice of Vashon Standing By put a certain series of tones over the air, a tone activated relay (that Steve is pointing to in the photo to the left) identifies this signal from the battery powered AM radio, and turns on the flashing light at the top of the outdoor sign for 15 minutes. Voice of Vashon will broadcast these tones periodically to keep the sign in an alerted status.\nThanks to VIFR’s Bob Larsen, Steve Allen, Daniel Luechtefeld, Jeff Hoyt, Mike Masi, Mark Bennion, Rick Wallace and the entire Voice of Vashon Standing By team for designing, installing and maintaining this innovative and critical system.

  "content":" Sept. 30, 2011\nTwo King County organizations honored with first-ever Executive\u0026rsquo;s Awards for Community Preparedness\nVashonBePrepared and Carnation-Duvall Citizen Corps Council recognized for preparedness and response efforts\nTwo local organizations were recognized today by King County Executive Dow Constantine for their commitment to emergency preparedness and response. VashonBePrepared and the Carnation-Duvall Citizen Corps Council were both honored with the first-ever Executive\u0026rsquo;s Awards for Community Preparedness.\n\u0026ldquo;When storms knocked out power and blocked roads last winter, I saw first-hand how members of VashonBePrepared jumped into action to open warming shelters and deploy a \u0026lsquo;bucket brigade\u0026rsquo; to distribute fuel for generators \u0026ndash; keeping Island residents from suffering in the cold,\u0026rdquo; said Executive Constantine. \u0026ldquo;I was also very impressed with the work of the Carnation-Duvall Citizens Corps Council to provide shelters and keep their community informed during flood events. I am pleased to honor the spirit of self-reliance shown by these hardworking volunteers and encourage others to follow their lead.\u0026rdquo;\nVashonBePrepared was chosen for its quick action after last year\u0026rsquo;s Thanksgiving week winter storm that knocked down power lines and left many Vashon and Maury Island residents in the dark. Volunteers also coordinated the emergency response with King County and Puget Sound Energy to restore power to the area in half the time originally forecast.\n\u0026ldquo;The impressive work done by VashonBePrepared in those cold, dark days went beyond the basics,\u0026rdquo; Executive Constantine said. \u0026ldquo;Their ongoing actions demonstrate a \u0026lsquo;whole community\u0026rsquo; approach to disaster response.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Island communities can be isolated from emergency resources if disaster strikes. Preparation is the most important thing a community can do to ensure their safety,\u0026rdquo; said Councilmember Joe McDermott who represents Vashon and Maury Islands. \u0026ldquo;VashonBePrepared is a model for other communities, and I commend them, their volunteers and partner organizations, and all the people of Vashon and Maury Islands for their exemplary work preparing for the unexpected.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Carnation-Duvall Citizen Corps Council was also honored by Executive Constantine. The council, one of the first of its kind in King County, is a partnership of local volunteer groups and first responders who are active in disaster preparedness and response.\n\u0026ldquo;Every year, residents of the Snoqualmie Valley experience flooding that impacts peoples\u0026rsquo; lives and livelihoods,\u0026rdquo; Executive Constantine said. \u0026ldquo;Through the planning and education efforts spearheaded by the Carnation-Duvall Citizen Corps Council, residents of the Snoqualmie Valley are better prepared to take action when floodwaters rise.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The dedicated volunteers in the Carnation-Duvall Citizen Corps Council are a huge asset to the community, and they continue with regular training and drilling nine years after formation of the Corps,\u0026rdquo; added Councilmember Kathy Lambert, who represents the Snoqualmie Valley communities and helped establish the organization. \u0026ldquo;They offer community emergency response team classes with the breadth and depth of information and experiences that empower residents to respond to many emergencies. Their efforts were recognized by FEMA Region X as one of the first and most successful Citizen Corps in the country, and they continue to provide an excellent model of grassroots community coordination.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As we head into another winter storm season, with the prospect of a \u0026lsquo;double-dip\u0026rsquo; La Ni\u0026ntilde;a on the horizon, it is more important than ever for communities to be prepared,\u0026rdquo; Executive Constantine said. \u0026ldquo;We encourage everyone to take the steps necessary to prepare themselves, their families, and their neighborhoods for emergencies.\u0026rdquo;\nFor tips and information on emergency preparedness, visit www.kingcounty.gov/prepare.\nRelated Information\nView a Flickr gallery of photos from today's awards ceremony.\nTo view the actual Award, see:\nhttp://vashoneoc.org/Blogs/VashonPreparedness/tabid/164/EntryId/179/King-County-Executive-Dow-Constantine-rsquo-s-2011-Award-for-Community-Preparedness-to-VashonBePrepared.aspx\nTo see our comments on the award, see: http://vashoneoc.org/Blogs/VashonPreparedness/tabid/164/EntryId/185/King-County-Executive-Dow-Constantine-Recognizes-Vashon-with-Inaugural-Community-Preparedness-Award.aspx\nLearn more about VashonBePrepared at www.VashonBePrepared.org\nLearn more about the Carnation-Duvall Citizen Corps Council at www.CarnationDuvallCitizenCorps.org\nThe above press release was issued by King County, and is directly available at http://www.kingcounty.gov/exec/news/release/2011/September/30Preparedness.aspx "},{

  "content":" The Associated Press came to this week\u0026rsquo;s 5th Annual Hazus conference held at the federal building and wrote up a nice piece citing (yet again) that we are not ready for the huge quakes possible from any number of faults, but especially the Seattle and Cascadia faults:\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; Of particular worry to government agencies - and emergency planners like Schelling - is the 680-mile long Cascadia fault line, which runs just 50 miles off Washington's shore. Scientists have found that a big 8.0 to 9.0 earthquake has hit that fault line about every 500 years. The last one struck in 1700. \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp; According to a 2005 study that used Hazus data, such a strong earthquake would level parts of the region, bringing landslides, tsunamis, fires, and spilling hazardous materials among other disastrous effects. This year, FEMA will partner with the Canadian government to do a bi-national model of a 9.0 earthquake hitting the Pacific Northwest, creating an updated examination of the 2005 study.\n-- Read the full story at www.komonews.com/news/local/127654203.html\nI also intend to write up more details about the conference (which I attended) in the coming days.\n"},{

Partners in Emergency Preparedness has conducted a very successful regional conference each spring for over 15 years. The Conference has grown into the largest emergency management conference in the Pacific Northwest, bringing together non-profit organizations, public agencies, business and industry, military, healthcare, and schools to explore emergency management issues, principles, and practices. The Conference is soliciting presentations regarding the on-going partnerships necessary to support successful emergency preparedness activities in all areas. Presentations that focus on lessons learned, best practices, participant interaction, and fostering partnerships in emergency management are strongly encouraged. Topics of interest include:\u0026#160;\u0026#160; First-hand accounts of lessons learned Disaster resilience/sustainability Practical application of scholarly research Case studies Business disaster preparedness and contingency planning Climate change and emergency management Continuity of Operations (COOP) New technological applications in emergency management Information management practices at different phases of a disaster Professional education and development Healthcare contingency planning and preparedness School preparedness Presentation sessions are 75 minutes in length, though a limited number of double sessions may be available. Our 2011 Conference drew over 600 attendees, including; 70 speakers, and more than 30 vendors over a two-day period. Conference attendees included emergency managers (local, state, and federal), state and local officials, business and industry representatives, the military reserve and National Guard, public utilities, and volunteer agencies. All submissions must be made online. Please note that the Partners in Emergency Preparedness conference does not typically pay honorariums or travel expenses, though they are considered on a case-by-case basis.

  "content":"The key Washington insider’s news organization has a new positive interview with FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate. It sounds like he wants to involve the community, and actually go beyond the lowest level first responders – and even beyond “able-bodied adults who have the financial means to meet basic needs“ – and instead focus on those the disasters typically impacts most: those less fortunate, pets and others they’ve had to previously specially address with annexes to the main plans. The new plans are supposedly much more oriented to those least resilient.\nReading between the lines, it also sounds like he’s going to use social media and direct community information to be more responsive – when it really counts. After Tom Miner’s indication that federal help can take 10-14 days to arrive, this would be a huge objective.\nSome excerpts:\nIn a major shift at FEMA, Fugate is looking beyond the information provided by professional first responders during an emergency, instead creating a two-way dialogue with the public, media and private sector to help provide quicker disaster assessments. […]\nFugate said he’s learned during his years of battling floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and wildfires at the local, state and now federal level that any agency’s response is slowed mainly by a lack of information. “I’ve learned that by the time I have all the facts to make the perfect decision, I was too late to respond,” he said.\nAttention to one of the largest costs of disasters – debris removal – is another new initiative. There’s more too, it is a good read! Check it out at: http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/170299-fema-chief-craig-fugate-rewrites-the-disaster-relief-playbook\n"},{

Field Day is open to all amateurs in the areas covered by the ARRL/RAC Field Organizations and countries within IARU Region 2. DX stations residing in other regions may be contacted for credit, but are not eligible to submit entries.\nOn Vashon we mainly treat it as a great social event to encourage prospective hams, give hands-on practice to new hams without their own radios, test our mobile communications trailer, educate officials, promote ARRL and amateur radio in general, make some contacts with remote stations, and perhaps most critically, to socialize! It is a highlight of the year.\nApparently the batteries got tested Saturday, when the main power wasn’t hooked up – or noticed for some time, until the battery alarms came on. Also John Galus performed some technical maintenance/fine tuning on the antenna shown the the right – using a couple sticks selected for their electrical and mechanical properties. (Our antenna had much greater reach than the professional one just behind!)\nThanks to the many volunteers making it possible, but especially key instigators Sharon Danielson, Georgia Galus, and Jim Tharp.\nFor all the photos of this year’s (\u0026amp; previous year’s) field day, simply join the VMIRC group at Yahoo: it is free, fun and fascinating.\nI see we’re up to 98 members – help us get over 100!\n"},{

  "content":"There is critical legislation regarding public safety organizations’ ability to communicate – without paying telecommunication companies huge fees (subsidies?!). A reprint on one side of this issue follows. (Note that VashonBePrepared has not taken a stance on this or any other legislative to date. We may in the future – our 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status only prevents us from spending a “substantial” portion of our budget for influencing legislation.)\nThe Politics of the D-Block: Now is the Time to Communicate with Your Members of Congress\nWilliam M. Webb, Executive Director, Congressional Fire Services Institute IF YOU WANT THE ASSURANCE OF COMMUNICATING WITH FELLOW FIRST RESPONDERS AT EMERGENCY SCENES, THEN NOW IS THE TIME TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: Securing the D Block for Public Safety\nWilliam M. Webb, Executive Director, Congressional Fire Services Institute\nFor the past 16 years, ever since I became Executive Director, I have had a dilettante’s understanding of the need for additional broadcast spectrum for public safety.\u0026#160; I use the term “dilettante” because one needs to have been in an emergency situation to truly understand the dangers experienced by first responders as a result inoperable communication systems.\u0026#160; I have not, nor for that matter have most of our elected leaders.\u0026#160; So when I hear fire officials testify on Capitol Hill about the need for additional spectrum and how this additional spectrum can enhance communication systems for our first responders, I value their testimony above all others.\nIn recent months, public safety has been well represented in congressional hearings addressing proposals for a national broadband communication system.\u0026#160; The uniforms worn by these officials convey a sense of credibility on the subject matter.\u0026#160; The D Block, as articulated by these expert panelists, is not a want; it’s a genuine need.\u0026#160; We have reached a critical juncture in the ongoing battle to secure additional spectrum for public safety and now is the time for individual fire service leaders to get engaged.\nAs many of you know, the battle is over 10 MHz of spectrum in the upper 700 MHz band known as the D block.\u0026#160;\u0026#160; Earlier in the year, public safety gained additional momentum for securing the D block when the Obama Administration shifted its position by proposing to set aside the D block for public safety in its Fiscal Year 2012 budget proposal.\u0026#160; The proposal also included $10 billion to build-out and maintain the public safety broadband network. Although the Obama Administration is now on board the D Block bandwagon in support of public safety, we have many more hurdles to clear before reaching the finish line of this protracted campaign.\u0026#160; Legislation is required to prevent the Federal Communications Commission from auctioning the spectrum in the D block for commercial uses.\u0026#160; If the auction occurs, public safety will have a difficult time building a reliable and secured nationwide interoperable public safety broadband network that will enable first responders access to time-critical data during large-scale emergencies.\nOn Capitol Hill, members of Congress have introduced legislation in both the House and Senate that would reallocate the 10 MHz of spectrum in the D block for public safety.\u0026#160; Senator John Rockefeller (WV) introduced S.911 and Senator Joseph Lieberman (CT) introduced S. 1040 with bipartisan support.\u0026#160; Both measures would clear the D Block for public safety use while setting aside federal funding from an auction of other spectrum to develop a broadband system.\u0026#160; Congressman Peter King (NY-3) has introduced HR 607.\u0026#160; King’s measure is similar to the two senate bills, clearing the D block for public safety use and providing federal funds through an auction to build a public safety broadband network system.\nOn June 8th, S. 911 cleared the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.\u0026#160; The 21-4 vote affirms the level of bipartisan support in the Senate chamber.\u0026#160; The measure now awaits the action of the full Senate. Whereas all three measures have widespread support from a broad range of public safety organizations, trade associations, and local and state governments, support is not unanimous both within the communication sector and on Capitol Hill.\u0026#160; Opponents offer a various reasons for their position.\u0026#160; Following the vote on the Rockefeller measure, one Senator cautioned that “the nation’s debt would increase by more than $17 billion by the enactment of this legislation.”\u0026#160; Conversely, proponents argue that the broadband network system would have a positive impact on the economy, creating an entirely new market for data-driven devices and applications, thereby stimulating competition, product innovation and entrepreneurship – three key factors that fuel our nation’s economic engine. Public safety is within reach of achieving a major victory that will have a far-reaching impact on the paramount issue of building a 21st century broadband network for first responders.\u0026#160; 21st century is what drives this debate for public safety.\u0026#160; The D block will allow us to build out a system using new technologies – some that might be in the conceptual stage –that will give public safety the cutting-edge technologies to respond to large-scale emergencies, allowing first responders on the scene access to mission-critical data that can save lives and reduce injuries and property loss.\nBut if Congress cannot approve the legislation pending in both the House and Senate and decides instead to allow the FCC to auction the D block to commercial bidders, public safety will be dealt a serious setback.\u0026#160; Once the spectrum is auctioned-off, public safety will be at the mercy of the commercial service providers occupying the D block to gain access during critical events and emergencies.\u0026#160; Is this a chance worth taking?\u0026#160; Certainly not, given the threats we are now facing in a post 9/11 world.\nHence, members of the fire and emergency services need to start calling their representatives and urging them to set aside the D block for public safety.\u0026#160; The Public Safety Alliance, a coalition of over 50 organizations and businesses advocating this cause, has information on their website discussing how fire service leaders and others can get engaged in this effort.\u0026#160; The address is PSAFIRST.ORG.\nThe window of opportunity is starting to close on this issue.\u0026#160; Your support is needed…now!\n"},{

  "content":"There are many federal entities that sponsor research, but a very few like the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) which provides a critical link between important research findings and practical application. For us in Washington—the second highest earthquake risk state in the country—putting good research to use is of the utmost importance. I asked EMD’s Earthquake Program Manager John Schelling say more about this great program, below. —Jim Mullen, director, Washington State Emergency Management\nIt’s not hard to see that our homes, our offices, our schools, and our overall communities are safer and more resistant to earthquake damage, thanks to NEHRP-sponsored research. Here are recent examples of Washington EMD initiative have been enhanced by NEHRP’s umbrella assistance: • Washington EMD has partnered with the federal and state agencies to develop 20 earthquake scenarios that will examine community vulnerability to faults throughout the state. This work will be incorporated into state and local mitigation and response plans, help drive exercises, and facilitate a better response when an earthquake occurs. • The Washington State Seismic Safety Committee is developing policy recommendations through a project entitled “The Resilient Washington State Initiative.” The RWS project examines our current capacity for resilience to damaging earthquakes and seeks to identify what gaps may exist. The Committee hopes this effort will provide a lasting foundation for future seismic policy to concretely address identified shortfalls in Washington State. • Demonstrating the true value of public-private partnerships, the Structural Engineering Association of Washington is assisting with a pilot project to systematically evaluate and establish the seismic risk for all public school buildings in the cities of Aberdeen and Walla Walla. The pilot will develop a methodology for prioritizing schools across the state that need seismic retrofitting and permit a strategic, targeted approach for providing a safe learning environment for Washington state’s most precious assets, our kids. Carrying out the project is a volunteer team led by Degenkolb Engineers CEO, Mr. Stacy Bartoletti, along with staff from the Washington Department of Natural Resources, Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction and EMD.\nNEHRP is “up for renewal.” On May 5, the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee approved an amended version of Senate Bill 646, which would reauthorize the NEHRP. It’s likely the House will soon begin to address this important piece of legislation through H.R. 1379.\nI hope you will take a moment to let our congressional delegation know about the value of NEHRP to Washington state. I am genuinely hopeful that the reauthorization of NEHRP will be accomplished and our nation, state and local communities will continue to be better prepared and able to bounce forward when the time comes.\n- John Schelling, Earthquake Program Manager, Washington State Emergency Management\n-- Both of these are excerpted from http://blogemd.blogspot.com/2011/06/making-research-real-scientists-and.html\nList of Federal and State Politicians for Vashon:\nhttp://hq-salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/5950/getLocal.jsp?zip=98070\nSome Earthquake probability data for Vashon:\nwww.homefacts.com/earthquakes/Washington/King-County/Vashon.html\n"},{

FEMA P-749 provides a non-technical and readily understandable explanation of the intent and requirements of the seismic design criteria found in the nation’s building codes and standards.\nOne of the goals of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) is to encourage design and construction practices that address the earthquake hazard and minimize the resulting risk to life and property. The publication of FEMA P-749, a companion guide to the 2009 edition of the NEHRP Recommended Seismic Provisions for New Buildings and Other Structures, FEMA P-750, reaffirms FEMA’s ongoing commitment to achieving this goal.\nOne of the goals of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) is to encourage design and construction practices that reduce the seismic risk to property and life. FEMA’s publication of the 2009 NEHRP Recommended Seismic Provisions, which serve as a national resource for design professionals and the standards and codes development community, is a major ongoing commitment to achieving this goal.\nThe seismic requirements in U.S. model building codes and standards are updated through the volunteer efforts of design professionals and construction industry representatives under a process sponsored by FEMA and administered by the Building Science Safety Council (BSSC). At regular intervals, the BSSC develops and FEMA publishes the NEHRP Recommended Seismic Provisions for New Buildings and Other Structures. The NEHRP Recommended Seismic Provisions and the building codes and standards based on its recommendations are technical documents used primarily by professionals. However, a non-technical explanation of these requirements is important to understanding how the nation’s building codes and standards work to protect the public from the risk presented by earthquakes and other hazards.\nTo order your copy of FEMA P-749 from the FEMA Publications Warehouse, call 1 (800) 480-2520 or fax your request to (240) 699-0525.\nTo view or download the publication, please visit the FEMA Library.\nTo view or download other NEHRP publications and products or to sign up for updates on earthquake risk mitigation publications, news, and events, visit Earthquake Publications and Tools.\n"},{

  "content":" Seattle, Washington, June 1, 2011 – On Friday, March 11, 2011 at 2:46 PM (local time), the northeast coast of Japan was struck by a magnitude 9.0 (M9.0) subduction earthquake as the boundary between the Pacific and the North American plates ruptured along an offshore section. The rupture extended about 200 miles along the Japan coast, resulting in approximately 100 feet of vertical slip and causing a series of devastating tsunamis. A similar event along the Cascadia Subduction Zone could extend from Vancouver Island to Northern California, affecting western Washington and Oregon communities.\nThe ground motion records indicate very strong ground shaking (\u0026gt;1.0g) with long duration (\u0026gt;3.0 minutes). The M9.0 earthquake and five aftershocks greater than M7.0 affected coastal areas as well as the Tokyo metropolitan area. The earthquake and tsunami resulted in approximately 15,000 fatalities, left approximately 12,000 missing, displaced 160,000, and caused an estimated $200-$300 billion in losses.\nRecognizing the impacts this earthquake may have on the Pacific Northwest, the Structural Engineers Association of Washington (SEAW) formed a reconnaissance team of engineers to observe and evaluate damage in the affected areas. The team traveled the metropolitan cities of Tokyo and Sendai, and along the Tohoku coast to observe the impacted areas. The team also met with Japanese earthquake research organizations, design/construction professionals, and public officials to learn more about the extent of the damage and standard design practices in Japan.\nThe team will present their findings at this seminar intended for anyone interested in first-hand accounts of the earthquake’s devastation and lessons learned for improving seismic safety in the Pacific Northwest.\nGENERAL INFORMATION Wednesday, June 15, 2011 4:00 PM—8:00 PM (sign-in begins at 3:30 PM) University of Washington Kane Hall, Room 120\nSEMINAR COST (includes box lunch-style dinner at mid-presentation break) SEAW/AIA Members/UW Faculty* $45.00 Non-Members $60.00 UW Student**/Unemployed Members* $15.00 Late Registration fee, additional $10.00 * SEAW/AIA 2011 Dues must be paid ** Students may attend for free without dinner \u0026#160;\nBRIEFING TOPICS Seismicity Overview • Damage from Ground Shaking • Geotechnical Effects • Building Code Comparison • Bridge and Roadway Performance • Industrial Facility Performance • School, Hospital, and Essential Facility Performance • Commercial and Residential Building Performance • Non-Structural Damage • Tsunami Damage • Implications for the Pacific Northwest \u0026#160;\nREGISTRATION Please register no later than Noon, Friday, June 10th to avoid late charge. Register online at seaw@seaw.org to reserve your spot. Prepayment is required.\nThe Structural Engineers Association of Washington (SEAW) is a not-for-profit professional organization of leading structural engineers dedicated to the advancement of excellence in structural engineering through building code advocacy, continuing education, research, emergency preparedness, exchange of ideas, and mentoring.

HAZUS uses state-of-the-art Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software combined with science, engineering and mathematical modeling to map and display hazard data and the results of damage and economic loss estimates for buildings and infrastructure. HAZUS-MH was developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under contract with the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS). NIBS gathered the top scientific and engineering minds in the nation to create HAZUS.\u0026#160; The earthquake model was first released in 1997 followed by a significantly improved HAZUS99, released in 1999. In 2004, HAZUS added flood and wind loss estimation capability, making it a multi-hazard loss estimation tool. Subsequent releases in 2005, 2006 and 2007 have improved HAZUS’ speed and analytical capacity. Now a seasoned multi-hazard disaster loss simulation tool, HAZUS MR4 gives the nation and communities a window into the future and a means to prioritize activities that will reduce disaster-related losses.\n"},{

An In-depth Guide to Citizen Preparedness. Host a neighborhood meeting to share concerns and join together to better plan and prepared for disasters! Check and change the batteries in your smoke alarms and replace all alarms that are more than 10 years old. Make sure you know where your local fire department, police station, and hospital are and post a list of emergency phone numbers posted near all the telephones in your home. Organize and practice a family fire drill — make sure your children know what your smoke detector sounds like and what to do if it goes off when they are sleeping. Locate the utility mains for your home and be sure you know how to turn them off manually: gas, electricity, and water. Create an emergency plan for your household, including your pets. Decide where your family will meet if a disaster does happen: 1) right outside your home in case of a sudden emergency, like a fire and 2) outside your neighborhood in case you can't return home — ask an out of town friend to be your \"family contact\" to relay messages. Prepare a 3-day disaster supply kit, complete with flashlights, batteries, blankets, and an emergency supply of water and food (and pet food!). Plan to hold a Neighborhood Watch meeting — your local Sheriffs' office or police station can help you get started or visit www.usaonwatch.org for more information. Check the expiration dates of all over-the-counter medications — discard all that are expired and replace any that are routinely needed. Make sure all cleaning products and dangerous objects are out of children's reach. Sign up for a first aid training course. Call your local American Red Cross chapter, the National Safety Council or American Safety \u0026amp; Health Institute to ask about courses in your area (www.redcross.org, www.nsc.org or www.ashinstitute.org).

  "content":" Up to forty percent of businesses affected by a natural or man-made major disaster never reopen Washington, D.C., June 2, 2011 /PRNewswire/ — Up to 40% of businesses affected by a natural or man-made disaster never reopen, according to the Insurance Information Institute. In a nationwide effort to raise the business community’s awareness about how to prepare their businesses and employees in the event of an emergency, the Advertising Council, in partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the American Red Cross, announced today the launch of new public service advertisements (PSAs) on behalf of Ready Business.\nAccording to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small businesses represent more than 99 percent of all employers. Unfortunately, small to medium-sized businesses are also the most vulnerable in the event of an emergency. An Ad Council survey reported that nearly two-thirds (62%) of respondents said they do not have an emergency plan in place for their business. By taking steps ahead of time, many of these businesses can be better prepared to survive and recover after an emergency.\n“Businesses small and large make up the backbone of economies in communities across our country,” said FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate. “Putting a disaster plan in motion now will improve the likelihood that businesses and organizations will not only survive and recover themselves, but also help their neighbors and communities recover more quickly.”\nProduced pro bono by advertising agency Brunner, the new television, radio, print, outdoor and Web banners encourage owners of small- to medium-sized businesses to take steps to prepare and plan in advance of an emergency in order to reduce the risk of losing their business in the event of a disaster. All of the PSAs direct audiences to visit www.ready.gov/business for online resources, including the Red Cross Ready Rating business preparedness assessment tool. This free, interactive tool provides business owners with a clear picture of the preparedness level of their business and what further steps they need to take to get their business ready.\n“We never know when or where disaster may strike, but we all want to be ready to protect our employees, families, and our communities,” said Gail McGovern, president and CEO of the Red Cross. “Everyone needs to play a role in emergency preparedness, and Ready Rating™ helps businesses and organizations understand if they are ready for an emergency.”\n“We are proud to partner with the Red Cross and FEMA to provide small business owners nationwide with the vital tools they need to take precautionary actions in advance of emergencies,” said Peggy Conlon, president and CEO of the Ad Council. “I strongly believe that these new PSAs will engage and motivate the business community to take the proper steps towards preparedness to protect their employees, operations and assets.”\n“We are proud to be associated with the important work FEMA is doing to educate Americans about being smart when it comes to preparing for disaster, especially at a time when many areas of the country are experiencing such dangerous and unpredictable weather,” said Brunner President Scott Morgan. “The creative dramatizes the aftereffects of a disaster in order to give small business owners a sense of the potential magnitude of the destruction. Our goal is to get them to be preemptive and develop a contingency plan well before disaster strikes.”\nLaunched in 2004, Ready Business is an extension of FEMA and the Ad Council’s Ready campaign. Since its launch, media outlets have donated more than $129 million in advertising time and space for the PSAs. The new PSAs will air in advertising time that will be entirely donated by the media.\n-see PSA previews at http://multivu.prnewswire.com/mnr/adcouncil/50292/\n"},{

Once the network's \"real-time\" functions are fully operational, PANGA will be able to pinpoint some earthquakes more quickly and accurately than traditional seismometers — and eventually issue warnings before destructive shaking hits cities or tsunami waves slam the shore.\nScientists use the GPS data to calculate the gradual buildup of strain on faults and identify the places most likely to pop. Dozens of the sensors also sit atop structures such as the Alaskan Way Viaduct and Howard Hanson Dam, on watch for unexpected slumps or jiggles.\n\"The Northwest is really leading the nation in this right now,\" said Melbourne, a geology professor at Central Washington University in Ellensburg, where PANGA is based.\n- See full story: www.seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2015183992_gps30m.html\n"},{

(A future class is already being organized according to a note on the club’s home page!) So there should be a great mix of experienced and novice hams – and the public is always very welcome to come to these events. Kids are especially encouraged to come and participate as many of our hams got their start at an early age while still in school.\nPractice for emergency field set-up and operations on alternate forms of power, emergency communications, contacting distant states and countries, sending pictures, emails and other digital transmissions over the radio and electronics are a number of other topics sure to be demonstrated or discussed during field day. Some operations may go into the night and events will wind up Sunday Morning with take-down.\n"},{

  "content":" Personal Localized Alerting Network (PLAN) is a new public safety system, announced May 10th, to send free text alerts to cell phones. Geographically-targeted Presidential, emergency and AMBER alerts will use unique vibrations and tones to send alerts of imminent threats to safety. PLAN complements the existing Emergency Alert System (prior to 1998 known as the Emergency Broadcast System) and will be implemented by the FCC and FEMA. While the Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) Is apparently voluntary, the Warning, Alert and Response Network (WARN) Act requires those wireless carriers to activate PLAN technology by April 2012.\u0026nbsp; AT\u0026amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon have pledged earlier support.\nThe infrastructure behind this is the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System \u0026ndash; Open Platform for Emergency Networks (IPAWS-OPEN) which uses a common, proven \u0026ldquo;Message Broker\u0026rdquo; pattern to deliver Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) messages through a diverse infrastructure as shown in the architecture diagram on the right. (Click it for a larger version.)\nObviously CMAS is just a small part of the overall system.\nIPAWS-OPEN 2.0 is in limited operation and IPAWS-OPEN 3.0 is in development with the detailed CAP 1.2 message structure being worked on. IPAWS-OPEN is not just for alerting, but also \u0026ldquo;situation reports, common operational picture snapshots, and other emergency related information\u0026rdquo;, so can be used to send private messages as well as public alerts.\nPer system architect Gary Ham\u0026rsquo;s unofficial estimates on May 18th, external testing in July/August are expected to lead to the first operational CMAS demos in NYC in September, with full operation in December.\nDue to authorization issues, I suspect any alerts to Vashon residents would have to (appropriately) originate at the WA State Military Department or King County level. Policies for management of the actual system are largely still to be determined.\nHowever, locally on Vashon, we are getting set up this summer with the state and county funded MyStateUSA.com\u0026rsquo;s alerting system, which is already CAP 1.1 compliant, so likely will quickly be upgraded to take advantage of this new source of messages - and maintain it\u0026rsquo;s multi-headed ability to send out alerts via email, text, fax, phone - and probably semaphore.\nA future blog is planned, to provide\u0026nbsp;more details about the cutting edge WA\u0026nbsp;State alerting\u0026nbsp;infrastructure run by Don Miller, KE7UUK, Director of Communications, Washington Department of Emergency Services - and how King County and Vashon fit into that.\nMyStateUSA should allow us to send alerts to our volunteers and perhaps even to the general public on Vashon (those who had opted-in) when appropriate, e.g., to report in to the EOC if it were activated. The estimated 10\u0026cent; per activation call sort of limits the frequency that we\u0026rsquo;d use this of course!\nVashonBePrepared already has the ability to alert the public via Voice of Vashon Standing By (1650 AM), our Constant Contact email lists (please subscribe), and the Regional Public Information Network (RPIN) \u0026ndash; for which we urge all Vashonites to subscribe to!\n"},{

  "content":" The USGS is trying to achieve a denser and more uniform spacing of seismographs in select urban areas to provide better measurements of ground motion during earthquakes. These measurements improve our ability to make rapid post-earthquake assessments of expected damage and contribute to the continuing development of engineering standards for construction. To accomplish this, we developed a new type of digital seismograph that communicates its data to the USGS via the internet. The seismographs connect to a local network via WiFi and use existing broadband connections to transmit data after an earthquake. The instruments are designed to be installed in private homes, businesses, public buildings and schools with an existing broadband connection to the internet.\n“NetQuakes?” - The name was apparently chosen with a nod to NetFlix, as these low cost seismographs can be delivered and returned via mail in case they need replacement!\nSign Up Over the next several years the USGS hopes to deploy many more of these seismographs in the Greater Seattle and several urban California areas. The USGS is collecting names and addresses of people who are willing to host one of these seismographs so that as they become available, they can place them in the most effective locations.\nPacific NW If you live in the Pacific NW (especially in the Seattle area), you can sign up if the location of your home or business is eligible.\nRegional Status as of December, 2010 Currently 42 instruments are installed in the greater Seattle area and about 20 more instruments in hand to be installed. Sites have been chosen for many of these but there is still a chance for a few new sites to be chosen. Because of recent funding problems the actual installation process has slowed down as PNSN staff must deal with other more pressing issues from time to time.\nI just signed up and got a report that all instruments were currently spoken for, but that more might become available in the future.\n-- Excerpted from http://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/netquakes/; NW Specific info at http://www.pnsn.org/OPS/netquakes.html; and\nKUOW’s May 10th Morning Edition report on the program.\n"},{

  "content":"AT\u0026amp;T has started selling portable cellular antennas so customers can provide their own wireless coverage in disaster-struck or remote areas. Typically cell phone companies deploy mobile trucks with larger mobile cell towers, but this gives responders control over their own deployments – albeit with fairly limited service:\nThe Remote Mobility Zone can handle 14 simultaneous calls, and data at less-than-broadband speeds. Coverage extends up to half a mile from the unit. The \"portable cell tower\" can also be mounted in a car or truck.\nThe Remote Mobility Zone's satellite dish provides an alternative form of backhaul. AT\u0026amp;T also sells satellite smartphones .

  "content":" King County OEM’s Pascal Schuback had a neat 138 character tweet today that took me well over an hour to digest:\nKnow the difference 2B ready RT @USGS: How much bigger is a 8.7 2A 5.8? Click \"Try It Yourself\" Calculator at top of http://go.usa.gov/baq\nAs they note on their site, http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/how_much_bigger.php:\nThe magnitude scale is really comparing amplitudes of waves on a seismogram, not the STRENGTH (energy) of the quakes. So, a magnitude 8.7 is 794 times bigger than a 5.8 quake as measured on seismograms, but the 8.7 quake is about 23,000 times STRONGER than the 5.8! Since it is really the energy or strength that knocks down buildings, this is really the more important comparison. This means that it would take about 23,000 quakes of magnitude 5.8 to equal the energy released by one magnitude 8.7 event.\nThe thing they don’t really mention is that these numbers discuss the total energy released by a quake – NOT the intensity of shaking on the surface as experienced by humans and buildings – which is known as the (Modified) Mercalli intensity scale. A deep quake (Nisqually was 6.8 on the moment magnitude scale but 32 miles deep) has a much less serious impact than a shallow quake – as was modeled by the recent Tacoma Fault scenario (7.1 at 9 miles deep). Shallow quakes are much more likely to have damaging aftershocks too boot. Local soils can further alter conditions felt on the surface, as the caption of the Tacoma Fault map indicates.\nProbably even more useful is the peak acceleration – which is used by the USGS for their http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/. Their documentation for this goes into hopeless detail on how best to measure the impact of quakes across the US.\nHow likely are any of these? That’s a whole other convoluted topic, but the simple answer is to go to http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/apps/ and map it yourself. Most anyway you look at this though: Vashon needs to be ready for a big one!\n"},{

  "content":" The Five-Year NIMS Training Plan, originally released February 2008 is being revised. The comment period for the new National Incident Management System Training Plan ended February 22, several hundred comments have been adjudicated, and just last week the document was transmitted up to FEMA Deputy Administrator Manning, according to the Emergency Management Institute. Final release is likely just weeks away - without new obstacles. Access the The NIMS Training Plan (Draft) at www.regulations.gov, Docket # FEMA-2009-0012.\nThe document has received a fundamental rewrite and is actually ~10% shorter, with a bit less background. For instance the figure at bottom-left (Operational Foundation for NIMS Training and Personnel Qualification Guidelines, from the Five-Year NIMS Training Plan) has been dropped.\nWhy is this important for Vashon preparedness efforts? Because this outlines what NIMS\u0026#160;training each of us should have in our roles as Single Resource Leader, Unit Leader, Branch Director, Section Chief or Incident Commander.\nMany Vashon volunteers attended ICS-100a and ICS-700 courses taught at VIFR’s Penny Farcy building back about January 2009. A few of us are also looking at attending ICS-300 and ICS-400 training this year.\nEveryone should look at the chart to the right and decide what courses apply to your position/role. We currently recommend that everyone active in the EOC or other leadership positions at least take the free, online courses at IS-100.b - Introduction to Incident Command System, ICS-100 and IS-700.a NIMS An Introduction. These courses will provide a common understanding of concepts and terminology that can streamline communications wit each other, with professionals in the field and - in a major (class II or I) incident, with outside agencies.\n\u0026#160;\nIn addition, this document outlines the training required for credentialing:\u0026#160; “In addition to delineating responsibilities and actions, the NIMS Training Plan defines the process for developing training and personnel qualification requirements for emergency management/response personnel.” (Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 13 / Thursday, January 20, 2011, page 3648)\n"},{

  "content":"Tom Miner, head of the Northwest's\u0026#160; sole FEMA Urban Search \u0026amp; Rescue Incident Support Team, riveted an overflow audience with a clear message that after a major regional disaster, federal help is very unlikely to arrive on Vashon for well over 3 days and likely 10 – or more – days. With massive needs, emergency managers must assign their limited resources to the locations where they can do the most good for the most people. The government will clearly strive to save the most lives: to cities, to large buildings and schools where there are large numbers of people – not to rural homes. Having been at most major disasters in recent decades, he was blunt that the government does not have the resources to quickly rescue small localities like Vashon.\nHe also was clear that the reports of potential earthquakes are our warning. We've had all the warning we're going to get, we know it's coming and we know it is up to each household to be prepared. There is not going to be another warning two days before the actual event: get your house in order NOW!\nIn his experience, with local rescue personnel maxed out and also suffering personal losses, households will be on their own for some time.\u0026#160; Basic supplies of water and less than tasty meals-ready-to-eat (MREs) may arrive in a week or so, but restoration of roads, power and water facilities may take weeks. The government will restore basic services, but every Vashonite can avoid many of these issues by retrofitting our houses and businesses for earthquakes, having 10-14 days of basic supplies stored outside the house, purchasing earthquake insurance,\u0026#160; and having an out-of-area point of contact that all family members know to reach to coordinate messages. Local radio stations (for us: Voice of Vashon 1650AM) are the best sources of Vashon-specific news.\nFrankly, we will be on our own after a disaster.\nThe crowd of well over 100 Vashon homeowners spilled out the main room of the Vashon Land Trust and filled the foyer. In addition to his message for homeowners, Miner also gave valuable advice to the many volunteers with VashonBePrepared and all the affiliated Vashon disaster preparedness groups. Miner, whose family were one of Vashon’s the first founding families, had praise for the volunteer model that characterizes our local preparedness efforts. The meeting began with a welcome and review of the accomplishments since the last Annual Meeting. An election was then held for the board of directors’ at-large members (congratulations to Donna Donnelly, Steve Snyder, Oz Osborne, Synthia Downs and Jill Janow) - who join ex officio board members (Rick Wallace, Catherine Rogers, May Gerstle, Ed Steyh, Joe Ulatoski, Hank Lipe, Rex Stratton, Scott Rice, Daniel Luechtefeld and myself).\nFire Chief Hank Lipe called out the many values of VashonBePrepared and spoke to Vashon Island Fire \u0026amp; Rescue’s (VIFR) role in disaster preparedness with a well received, humorous and inspired talk, before Joe Ulatoski introduced keynote speaker Tom Miner.\n"},{

  "content":"Curious how Seattle handles citizen preparedness education and communication flows, I’m at the most recent Community Preparedness Summit, hosted by Seattle OEM’s Mark Howard and Barb Graff this morning. In addition to making lots of contacts from VashonBePrepared’s sister organizations on this side of the ocean, I was especially interested to learn more about how Seattle encourages and teaches their citizens to prepare for whatever events lie ahead.\nAs shown on the diagram to the right, there are multiple levels of involvement including the program. From family preparedness, to block level Block Watch, on up to the larger neighborhood level new Emergency Communication Hub program and finally the limited professional support they have a number of active programs.\nIf you are interested in following all of Seattle’s preparedness efforts, sign up for The Monthly Connection newsletter.\nSeattle Neighborhoods Actively Prepare (SNAP) VashonBePrepared has done significant educational outreach in the past at community events, in the Vashon Beachcomber and The Loop newsletters, and through our website, but we do not have a regular curriculum for homeowners or NERO captions. The closest we’ve come are the excellent CERT training classes taught through the years by Michael and Catherine Cochrane.\nI’m specifically interested to look at what can be offered to homeowners in terms of building a family communications plan and go kit, ensuring their next re-model takes cost effective steps to insulate and reduce seismic damage, and learning more about how to join to form their own local NERO, and how those neighborhood groups work with the rest of the VashonBePrepared infrastructure that has been built up over the years.\nLast Thursday, KUOW’s Weekday show Host Steve Scher had frequent guest Roger Faris on to discuss classes offered by the The Phinney Neighborhood Association and Project Impact’s Home Retrofit Classes. How can we get these on Vashon for our homeowners?!\nOver the years I’ve been aware of Seattle’s Seattle Neighborhoods Actively Prepare (SNAP) program and learned what I could, but today got a great overview of SNAP from Seattle OEM’s Debbie Goetz, one of three SNAP instructors. Going forward we might be able to send a few locals to one of their future train-the-trainer Leadership Academy programs – who could then come and present local classes. Ms. Goetz also suggested we consider having a ‘Disaster Day’ oriented at homeowners with a variety of experts and sessions they could attend through the morning or day. Nice idea!\nEmergency Communication Hubs The other new idea is a fairly recent program (apparently instigated after boy scouts questioned how the city could effectively communicate with all the block level organizations around the city) for central gathering places for neighborhood information sharing. Any that were able would be established after a major event where phone, roads, and other services were compromised.\nThese hubs are NOT places to get first aid, food or shelter, but rather generally open areas (often large parking lots) where citizens know in advance they can go to find out the latest news and communicate their needs up to the city. Bulletin boards with paper notes and GRMS radios (3 GRMS radio repeaters and a hub-to-hub repeater are already in place, with additions planned) are the fundamental technology to be employed.\nEach hub has a bin or kit stored nearby and a fairly extensive team of volunteers that can take and log messages and communicate those up to the city. The chart to the right shows the essential communication flow as currently envisioned.\nThe map to the left shows the 9 hubs planned for West Seattle. (Click it to learn more about their program.) Capital Hill is planning for 3 hubs, Wallingford for 7, Green Lake for 4 (2 of Green lakes and Wallingford’s are co-located). View Ridge, Phinney, Broadview and other communities are exploring how many they should set up based on geography and anticipated volunteers.\nSeattle’s new hub plans correlate closely with Vashon’s plans for 5 fixed (plus one mobile) ARES Local Area Communication Centers (LACCs), which are collocated at each VIFR fire station with CERT run Command Posts and Public Information centers where citizens and our Neighborhood Emergency Response Organizations (NEROs) can come to report their needs and likewise learn about shelter, medical and food resources available. Because of the greater distances involved, ours rely on ARES radio operators for communications and Message Center Messengers for material and physical package delivery with the central Vashon EOC.\n[Update: Also see Karen Berge’s excellent write-up of the morning’s activities!]\n"},{

  "content":"On March 30th, President Obama signed a Presidential Direction on the subject of “National Preparedness”, reflecting upon H1N1, Deepwater Horizon Christchurch and Sendai events - and lessons learned since the previous December 2003, Bush-era policy.\u0026#160;\nUnusually, the text was released today, only the second of his six directives released to date, per the Federation of American Scientists. They say the directive, “generally calls for development of systematic response plans for natural and manmade disasters, and seeks to enlist broad engagement in the process.” Presidential Policy Directives carry the force of executive orders, but originate from the National Security Council and can be classified.\nAccording to National Journal’s breaking article,\nthe Obama directive places significant emphasis on an \"all-of-nation\" \"all-hazards\" approach to disasters, fusing together the capabilities of federal, state, and local authorities to respond to crises. It refocuses government resources on mitigation - preventing catastrophes from getting worse - and resilience - how communities actively respond to and recover from a major disaster.\nThe Department of Homeland Security will set up a National Preparedness System to enable the nation to achieve the preparedness goal and undertake a national preparedness campaign and an annual National Preparedness Report for accountability. Better communications from the government to communities (a nod to IPAWS \u0026amp; OPEN?!) are called for as well as more collaboration with businesses.\nOther commentary, by Eric Holdeman and Government Executive generally reiterated this.\nMy quick summary of the actual directive: \u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; Everyone has to help with preparedness \u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; The Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism shall develop an implementation plan within 60 days to create a “national preparedness goal” within 180 days. \u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; The plan shall “assign departmental responsibilities and delivery timelines for the development of the national planning frameworks and associated interagency operational plans” described in the balance of the directive. \u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; “The national preparedness goal shall define the core capabilities necessary to prepare for the specific types of incidents that pose the greatest risk to the security of the Nation, and shall emphasize actions aimed at achieving an integrated, layered, and all-of-Nation preparedness approach that optimizes the use of available resources.” \u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; A description of a National Preparedness System shall be submitted to the President within 240 days, with annual progress reports thereafter. \u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; “The national preparedness system shall be designed to help guide the domestic efforts of all levels of government, the private and nonprofit sectors, and the public to build and sustain the capabilities outlined in the national preparedness goal. The national preparedness system shall include guidance for planning, organization, equipment, training, and exercises to build and maintain domestic capabilities. It shall provide an all-of-Nation approach for building and sustaining a cycle of preparedness activities over time.” \u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; Calling for a “framework of integrated planning frameworks”, it sounds like more work needs to be done to integrate the National Response Framework, NIMS and ICS – and that conformance to all these must remain inconsistent nationally. \u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; All federal agencies need a conops; lists of tasks and responsibilities; detailed resource, personnel, and sourcing requirements; \u0026amp; provisions to rapidly integrate resources and personnel \u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; Everyone everywhere should develop plans \u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; Guidance for planning, resources, equipment, training and exercises shall come from on high. \u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; National consistency of approach and methodology and measurement towards the big goal is desirable. \u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; DHS shall create a comprehensive campaign to build and sustain national preparedness with lots of programs at various levels \u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; Roles and Responsibilities are set out. \u0026#160;\u0026#160;\u0026#160; Directive replaces 17 Dec 2003 Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-8 (National Preparedness) \u0026amp; 4 Dec 2007 HSPD-8 Annex I (National Planning).\nOverall, I say it means that the nation needs a consistent framework, terminology and plan for dealing with threats to our livelihood – apparently as the current frameworks aren’t consistent/well crafted/followed. All this is worthwhile certainly, but the devil’s in the details – and whether the updated frameworks are well architected.\n"},{

VashonBePrepared, in conjunction with the King County Office of Emergency Management (OEM) urges citizens to take simple steps to prepare for earthquakes, floods, man-made disasters and other emergencies.\n“We can’t stop disasters from happening, but we can prepare to survive them,” says OEM Director Hillman Mitchell. “Now is a perfect time to think about what you would do if a large disaster were to strike our region.\"\nDisaster planning consists of three simple steps: 1. Make a Plan Every family should have a plan for how they will communicate during an emergency and where they will meet if separated.\nEstablish an out-of-area contact. This should be someone out-of-state that each family member can contact to communicate their well-being.\nTexting will often work, even if phone calls can’t go through.\nIf cell towers are down, landline calls may work.\nLong-distance calls often go through when local calls don’t.\nEstablish a meeting place near your home where family members will go if it’s not safe to stay in your house or apartment.\n2. Build a Kit Having basic emergency supplies on hand will not only keep you alive, but more comfortable during the first few days of a disaster. A minimum three-day supply of the following items is recommended:\nReady-to-eat food\nWater (1 gallon per day, per person)\nMedications and personal hygiene items\nYou’ll also want to pack:\nRadio (battery-powered or hand-crank style)\nExtra batteries\nSturdy shoes and warm clothing\nBlanket\nFlashlight\nWhistle\nDust mask\nPutting these items together in one place will ensure you will have what you need, quickly. You should have emergency kits for your home, vehicle and work or school.\nA complete emergency kit checklist can be downloaded at www.3days3ways.org or www.takewinterbystorm.org (translated in multiple languages).\n3. Get involved Resilient communities don’t just happen; they are built by individuals working together.\n\u0026#160;\nGet to know your neighbors. A trusted friend next door can keep an eye on your property, your kids and pets if an emergency keeps you from getting home. Volunteer to serve on your local Community Emergency Response Team (CERT). CERT groups receive training and resources to help address immediate needs, until emergency personnel are able to respond. Learn CPR and basic first aid – it can make the difference between life and death for someone close to you.\nThere are a number of additional ways citizens can prepare for emergencies that are free and require little effort: Stay informed Tune in to TV and radio stations during an emergency (if a power outage occurs, you’ll be glad you have a battery-powered radio and batteries on hand).\n\u0026#160;\nRegister for emergency alerts Most cities have an automated public alert system that can quickly notify residents to evacuate, stay in place, or take specific actions. Contact your local Office of Emergency Management to register. You can also register for regional emergency, transportation and general safety alerts at the Regional Public Information Network (RPIN) website, www.rpin.org.\n\u0026#160;\nParticipate in the statewide earthquake drill on April 20 at 9:45 a.m. The regular monthly test of the Emergency Alert System will include a statewide “Drop, Cover, and Hold” earthquake drill. By practicing what you should do when the ground begins to shake, you’ll develop an automatic response when a real disaster strikes. Encourage your school or place of business to participate by tuning in to KIRO 710 AM radio. When the simulated earthquake is announced:\nDROP… to the floor\nTake COVER… under a desk or sturdy table\nHOLD on… until the drill is over\nTake advantage of free resources to help you prepare\nA new earthquake guide is available to help businesses protect employees, assets and business continuity after a large scale earthquake. Visit King County Emergency Management's business preparedness web page for a downloadable copy or contact your local Office of Emergency Management.\nAttend local Disaster Preparedness Fairs. Check with your local city to find out about upcoming opportunities to talk to local elected officials, emergency responders, and disaster preparedness experts.\nFor more information about emergency planning, visit the King County Office of Emergency Management web site at www.kingcounty.gov/prepare and VashonBePrepared’s website at www.VashonBePrepared.org.\n"},{

  "content":" In just the last two years, federal earthquake scientists have completed analysis of the Tacoma Fault. As it turns out, the Tacoma Fault actually runs directly across the center of Vashon, the community that could be most affected if it ruptures. The latest computer analysis indicates that shaking from the fault could be as severe as the recent earthquakes in Christchurch and Sendai. That makes it doubly or even triply important for all of us to be prepared to sustain ourselves for as long as 10 days at home until help can arrive.\nThe keynote speaker for the VashonBePrepared annual community meeting on Wednesday, April 13th will be Thomas Miner, an expert on disaster response who has helped conduct search and rescue operations at most of the major catastrophic events affecting the U.S. in the last several decades. He wrote the federal practice exercise scenario for the Tacoma Fault.\nMiner recently retired from the Pierce County Department of Emergency Management as a program manager for the Washington Urban Search and Rescue Task Force, on call for dispatch nationwide to major emergencies. Prior to that, he was a major in the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department. He’ll be talking about lessons learned while organizing communities to respond to disasters, chasing hurricanes and finding missing persons.\nThere will be plenty of opportunity to ask Miner questions. Refreshments will be served from 6:30 PM on at the Vashon-Maury Island Land Trust, 10014 SW Bank Rd. All are welcome to come learn about this vital information.\nCaption: Earthquake scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey use computers to generate “shake maps” like this one. The stripe in the center of the shake map, colored red, shows where the most intense shaking would occur in a hypothetical 7.1 magnitude earthquake on the Tacoma Fault. Geological evidence indicates a similar earthquake last occurred about 1,100 years ago. More details of the Tacoma Fault Scenario study can be seen at http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2010/3023/.\n"},{

By filtering for keywords and locating these reports on a map, a wide variety of emergency managers, researchers, and citizens can rapidly get a better feeling for late breaking information – well before a reporter or others have had time to synthesize the data into a summary or overview.\nKathleen Farrell just pointed out this excellent article, Academics Join Relief Efforts Around the World as Crisis Mappers, from the Chronicle of Higher Education that provides a good overview of this info – points out some of the open source software (from Ushahidi) that is being used behind the scenes to make this happen.\nIt would be fun to see if we could add some of this functionality to our own web site – so we could rapidly set up a situational information page – at least for internal if not also external use after an event. Something like this would allow business owners to report in with their status via a variety of means. Currently we’re exploring use of Google Maps for managing our critical locations, but this would take things another level deeper!\nKing County is also looking at a regional situational awareness upgrade, to advance beyond what WebEOC can provide, so ideally all these systems can play well together.\n"},{

  "content":"Release Date and Time:03-25-2011 08:19:00 AM\n\"Triangle of Life\" theory is dismissed by quake experts. The technique is not applicable for earthquake experiences in the U.S. The safest response is to \"Drop, Cover, and Hold\" until the ground stops shaking.\nWith images of Japan’s devastating earthquake fresh on our minds, so is another round of Internet misinformation about what should be your first move during an earthquake. The King County Office of Emergency Management wants you to know that \"Drop, Cover, and Hold\" is the best method to protect yourself during an earthquake in the United States, especially in our own quake-prone region.\n“Unfortunately, emails have circulated recently, touting the ‘Triangle of Life’ technique, which incorrectly claims that people can use ‘voids’ or ‘empty spaces’ as a way to survive earthquakes,” said Hillman Mitchell, Director of the King County Office of Emergency Management. “Simply put, the technique is not applicable for earthquake experiences in the United States.”\nExperts, from medical doctors to international search and rescue teams, agree: \"Drop, Cover, and Hold\" is your best move to reduce injury and death during an earthquake. Methods like standing in a doorway, running outside, and searching for a potential \"triangle of life\" are considered dangerous and are not recommended. Here’s why:\nMany injuries from earthquakes are caused from people running around while the ground is shaking. They fall down, run into furniture, step on broken glass, or are hit by falling objects.\nIn and around older buildings especially, there is a much higher likelihood of broken windows, falling bricks, and other dangerous debris.\nDespite the urge to flee, experts advise people to stay put – you are more protected indoors under a sturdy desk or table.\nEarthquakes in the U.S. do not typically result in total building collapse (“pancaking”) due to high building construction standards.\nThe \"Triangle of Life\" theory also encourages people to roll out of bed on to the floor if caught asleep during an earthquake. Again, quake experts agree that staying in bed can provide more protection during an earthquake than rolling onto the floor beside it, where you could be injured by falling objects. Their point is this: the more you move during an earthquake, the more potential there is for injury.\nBill Steele, seismology lab coordinator at the University of Washington, has years of experience studying how earthquakes behave. “The emergency management community has worked for decades researching earthquake response and recovery throughout the world and gathering best practices,\" said Steele. \"We know what works. In the urgency of disaster, people need to instinctively know what to do. And the right message is to ‘Drop, Cover, and Hold.’\"\nBeing ready for an earthquake includes practicing what you’ll do when the earth shakes so that a safe response becomes automatic. Residents and businesses are encouraged to participate in the statewide earthquake drill on April 20th at 9:45 a.m., or to conduct their own drill at another convenient time.\nTo learn more about earthquake safety and mitigation, please visit the King County Office of Emergency Management.

  "content":"Diesel-powered unit will serve community shelter during power outages\u0026#160; Franciscan Health System has donated a large emergency-power generator to the community of Vashon Island so residents can have a safe, warm, lighted building in which to seek shelter when Mother Nature knocks out electricity to homes and businesses in the area.\nThe 350-kilowatt unit holds 500 gallons of diesel fuel, enabling it to generate electrical power for several hours. Manufactured by Onan, the generator is equipped with an automatic transfer switch that turns on the diesel-powered unit when normal electrical service is interrupted by events like windstorms and earthquakes.\n“We are grateful to Franciscan Health System for this much-needed equipment,” said Chief Hank Lipe of Vashon Fire and Rescue. “It will afford us the ability to provide a fully powered and functional 24-hour, life-sustaining shelter for Vashon in case of a damaging earthquake or other major disaster.”\nHe is working with representatives of the Vashon School District to determine which local school would be the best fit for the generator. “We are currently looking at Chautauqua Elementary School, which meets seismic safety standards for the hook up, but the decision has yet to be finalized,” Lipe said.\nHomes, businessess and public buildings on Vashon Island darkened abruptly Nov. 22, 2010 after a bitterly cold snowstorm, combined with high winds, cut off electricity to the entire island. Thousands of people were without electricity for several hours.\n“We are pleased to donate this potentially lifesaving equipment to a community recently gripped by a winter storm that caused a dangerous power outage,” said Franciscan Foundation President Jon Flora, a resident of Vashon. “That frightening event dramatically proved the need for a designated emergency shelter. This powerful generator will help the community’s leaders to establish such a place for the safety of the island’s residents.” The generator is about 25 feet long, 10 feet tall and eight feet wide, with an estimated value of $50,000. For the past seven years, it had been on the campus of Franciscan’s Enumclaw Regional Hospital. That aging facility closed on Feb. 2 when Franciscan opened St. Elizabeth Hospital in Enumclaw.\nIn all, Franciscan has donated three emergency-power generators from the former Enumclaw hospital. The other units have been accepted by the cities of Enumclaw and Buckley.\nBased in Tacoma, Franciscan Health System is among the largest health providers in Washington. Franciscan has hospitals in Tacoma, Federal Way, Gig Harbor, Lakewood and Enumclaw, in addition to medical clinics in Pierce, King and Kitsap counties.

The ultimate goal of the exercise-series is to improve the collective operational readiness of emergency/ disaster managers, and other public safety institutions that are participating in the exercise. The three exercises in the series and their tentative dates are:\nFunctional Exercise (June 5-6, 2012) Logistics Exercise/Drill (June 12-14, 2012) Recovery Table Top Exercise (August 15 and August 22, 2012) Achieving our collective exercise goals will require a well designed and effectively executed set of exercises. This will be the charge of the ‘Evergreen Quake’ Exercise Design Interagency Working Committee and its respective Subcommittees. Working together, Puget Sound Area city, county, state, federal, non governmental, and private sector officials that volunteer to serve on the various ‘Evergreen Quake’ exercise design and planning subcommittees will collaboratively build a realistic-as-possible set of exercises through the development of comprehensive scenario documents, a challenging Master Scenario Events List, and a\u0026#160; robust simulation and control cell.\n- ORIENTATION SEATTLE FAULTlow-res1.pdf\nScenario What else, our favorite: a BIG earthquake!

  "content":"The Pacific Northwest is exploring solutions that can provide officials an overview of a regional event.\nThe existing situation is very fragmented:\nWA State is currently using ESI’s WebEOC (for which Vashon has an account) \u0026amp; ESiWebFUSION but this has an older architecture \u0026amp; cumbersome user interface and doesn’t readily allow integration with other technologies in use elsewhere. The state has a wrapper or GIS based viewer for WebEOC, known as the Washington Information Sharing Environment (WISE) that also aggregates additional data (including from the military, as it was developed by the National Guard) I’m not aware of what FEMA or DHS uses, but I suspect it is something else. Neighboring states use WebEOC and other custom solutions. (Oregon is adopting – with some trouble- a more regional system: Virtual Emergency Network of Multnomah, for instance.) King County has an independent solution, their SharePoint site (for which we also have an account). Seattle uses their own WebEOC instance. Vashon and other regional partners can’t afford the equipment, infrastructure, training that all these typically require, – or we’re locked out due to not meeting their security concerns - so have our own simplified solution consisting primarily of an incident log, a wiki that serves as a knowledgebase that all can contribute to, and an integrated document repository for documents that require a specialized editor or have a life outside the web site. The new solution seems to be using the federal preferred solution known as virtual USA, aka vUSA, but apparently strives to integrate data from Washington via their WISE application - that is built using the trac software project management system and Adobe tools - including Flex that can encumber client installations and face a rocky future with the advent of HTML 5.\nIdeally this vUSA solution may allow more readily capturing data from the clunky WebEOC interface and express it in a more flexible form. Whether localities such as Vashon will ever have rights to access this data is unknown, but I suspect it won’t be easy!\nMore on this new demo/initiative is hard to come by, but the PNW Pilot web site ahs some details:\n“The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Pacific Northwest (PNW) Virtual USA (vUSA) pilot was launched in September 2009 in partnership with Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington and Montana. The goal of the PNW pilot is to enable the states, as well as the region, to demonstrate a capability by the end of 2010 that significantly improves state and regional information sharing and collaboration, and thus aids decision-making during day-to-day and emergency operations across jurisdictions and disciplines.”\nA search turned up this nice story on the initiative.\nIn another initiative, FEMA is also working on a new alerting protocol IPAWS-OPEN for alerting the public, thus serving a different niche.\nWhat we will end up using for situational awareness on Vashon is up for grabs, but for now having our own solution (i.e., www.VashonEOC.org) allows us to customize functionality based on our needs (e.g., the incident log, wiki and document repository), serve up data to SharePoint or WebEOC or something else in the future, and to consume data from these or other varied inputs such as NOAA, Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, our volunteers on the streets of Vashon.\n"},{

It concludes with these implications:\nChile is making headway in rebuilding its heartland following a massive subduction zone earthquake that affected modern structures as far away as Santiago (335 km from the epicenter). However, the recovery from a major earthquake need not be a lengthy process. Organizations with earthquake exposures can learn from this event and should consider proactive steps to enhance safety, reduce damage, and minimize downtime. • Review business recovery plans to include dedicated resources (contactors, suppliers, and engineers). • For existing operations, assess earthquake risks (buildings, contents, and critical lifelines) and identify specific areas of improvement relative to safety and business risks. • For proposed construction, perform independent design reviews to verify the desired seismic performance. Building codes tend to focus on occupant safety rather than limiting damage in a major earthquake. • Verify seismic restraint of equipment and contents. This is a cost-effective method of loss control.\n"},{

  "content":"California has more risk of catastrophic storms than any other region in the country – even the Southern hurricane states, according to a new study released Thursday.\nThe two-year study by the U.S. Geological Survey is the most thorough effort yet to assess the potential effects of a \"worst-case\" storm in California.\nIt builds on a new understanding of so-called atmospheric rivers, a focusing of high-powered winds that drag a fire hose of tropical moisture across the Pacific Ocean, pointed directly at California for days on end. The state got a relatively tame taste of the phenomenon in December.\nThe team of experts that developed the scenario can't say when it will happen. But they do say it has happened in the past and is virtually certain to strike again.\n\"This storm, with essentially the same probability as a major earthquake, is potentially four to five times more damaging,\" said Lucy Jones, USGS chief scientist on the study. \"That's not something that is in the public consciousness.\"\nThe study aims to fix that.\nA conference on the subject, ending today at California State University, Sacramento, brings together hundreds of emergency planners to discuss the worst-case storm and how to prepare for it.\nThe USGS is assessing a variety of natural hazards across the country. California was chosen for the latest project, called ArkStorm, because the state \"has the potential for the biggest rainfall events in the country,\" Jones said.\n- By Matt Weiser.

That’s according to a new report supported by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. In fact, the report says “there’s an emergency for emergency health preparedness in the United States.” It calls attention to significant local, state and federal budget cuts and the impact they have had on public health departments’ ability to maintain staff capabilities, and their ability to respond to crises. Key findings include: * 21 states were not able to rapidly identify disease-causing E.coli O157:H7 and submit the lab results in 90 percent of cases within four days during 2007-2008. * 33 states and D.C. cut funding for public health from Fiscal Year 2008-2009 to FY 2009-2010. * Seven states can not currently share data electronically with health care providers. * 10 states do not have an electronic syndrome surveillance system that can report and exchange information. * Six states reported that pre-identified staff were not able to acknowledge notification of emergency exercises or incidents within the target time of 60 minutes at least twice during 2007-2008. * Six states did not activate their emergency operations center a minimum of two times in 2007-2008. * Two states did not develop at least two After-Action Report/Improvement Plans (AAR/IPs) after exercises or real incidents in 2007-2008.

  "content":"Red Cross Encourages Safety During Excessive Heat American Red Cross\nAs the temperature continues to increase as it is predicted to this week, the American Red Cross encourages individuals and families to take the necessary precautions for excessive heat. The very young and the elderly are especially vulnerable to the heat so it is important that families and friends check on them regularly. People with chronic health issues are also at greater risk and need to take special care to stay healthy in the heat.\nPreventing Heat-Related Illness\nThere are several precautions you can take to avoid heat-related injury and illness.\n• Dress for the heat. Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing (light colors reflect away some of the sun\u0026rsquo;s energy) and use a hat or an umbrella.\n• Carry water or juice with you and drink frequently, even if you do not feel thirsty. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, which dehydrate the body.\n• Make sure to check on youth and elderly to make sure they have enough fluids.\n• Eat small meals and eat more often. Avoid foods that are high in protein, which increases metabolic heat.\n• Avoid using salt tablets unless directed by a physician.\n• Avoid strenuous activity. If you must do something physically demanding, do it during the coolest part of the day, which is usually between 4:00 and 7:00 a.m.\n• Stay indoors as much as possible.\n• Take regular breaks when engaging in physical activity on warm days.\n• Take time out to find a cool place.\nWatch for signs of heat stroke: Heat stroke is life-threatening. The person\u0026rsquo;s temperature control system, which produces sweating to cool the body, stops working. The body temperature can rise so high that brain damage and death may result if the body is not cooled quickly.\n• Hot, red, and usually dry skin, but in some cases such as during athletic activity while wearing a helmet, the skin may be moist\n• Changes in consciousness\n• Rapid, weak pulse, and\n• Rapid, shallow breathing.\n• Call 9-1-1 or your local EMS number.\n• Move the person to a cooler place.\n• Quickly cool the body by wrapping wet sheets around the body and fan it. If you have ice packs or cold packs, place them on each of the victim\u0026rsquo;s wrists and ankles, in the armpits and on the neck to cool the large blood vessels.\n• Watch for signals of breathing problems and make sure the airway is clear.\n• Keep the person lying down.\nProtecting Your Pets\nMany people include their pets in outdoor activities, but animals, like humans, can easily overheat during the hot summer months. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) recommends these tips to prevent heat-related illness in a pet:\n• Limit exercise to the coolest part of the day, typically early in the morning. Even in the coolest part of the day, watch for signs of trouble. Glassy eyes and frantic panting indicate a dog needs help.\n• Make sure your dog has constant access to shade and an endless supply of cool, clean water.\n• Never leave a dog in a car, even for a few minutes.\n• Remember that older, obese and short-nosed dogs are less tolerant of heat.\n• Pet owners should be especially vigilant for signs of heat stroke.\n• Heat stroke in animals can be deadly and requires emergency medical attention. While seeking medical help, cool the animal down with wet towels, spray him/her with cool water, or provide ice chips for him/her to chew if conscious.\nSymptoms of heat stroke in animals can include the following:\n• Sluggish and non-responsive demeanor\n• Bright red and/or dry tongue and gums\n• Vomiting or diarrhea\n• Unusual breathing patter, heavy panting, or high heart rate\nTo learn more about summertime safety for pets, contact your local Humane Society.\nAdditional information is available on Public Health- Seattle \u0026amp; King County\u0026rsquo;s website: http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/news/2008/BeatTheHeat.aspx\nEnjoy the sun!!\nRobin Pfohman\nProgram Manager, Vulnerable Populations Action Team\nPublic Health - Seattle \u0026amp; King County 401 Fifth Avenue, 13th floor Seattle, WA 98104 Phone: 206.263.8759 Fax: 206.296.0629 Website: http://www.metrokc.gov/health/VPAT/\nrobin.pfohman@kingcounty.gov\nCategories of Health Messages\nHealth Alert: conveys the highest level of importance; warrants immediate action or attention.\nHealth Advisory: provides important information for a specific incident or situation; may not require immediate action.\n"},{
