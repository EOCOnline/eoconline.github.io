      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve waited weeks to write this post because the news reports have been quite disturbing. Itâ€™s been over a month now since the April 25th earthquake of magnitude 7.8 struck northwest of Kathmandu, Nepal, killing over 8,000 people and injuring many thousands. The local, regional and national governments of Nepal are overwhelmed, and leaders have called for international aid, which usually takes weeks to arrive. Conditions there are still very grim, people are not yet safe from further harm, and recovery will likely take many years. &lt;br /&gt;&#xA;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
