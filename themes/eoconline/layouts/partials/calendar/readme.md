# Calendar Partial/Widget

## Intro

An activity calendar-widget is well known from content management systems like Wordpress. Users can see the activities/posts written in a calendar view and navigate through the archive. In this article, I show you one possible approach to achieve this with Hugo.

## Usage & Parameters

**Usage:** {{ partial "calendar" (dict "context" . "from" 2016 "fromMonth" 10 "to" (now.Format "2006") "toMonth" (now.Format "1") "pages" .Site.Pages) }}

### Parameters

**context**
This is crucial to pass the current context into the partial. While partials have an own context otherwise without access to the related parent context.

**from**
This is the year as (YYYY) when you want to start the calendar.

**fromMonth**
This is the month as a single digit number without leading zero in which month the calendar needs to start (including this month).

**to**
This is the year as (YYYY) when you want to end the calendar.

**toMonth**
This is the month as a single digit number without leading zero in which month the calendar needs to stop (including this month).

**pages**
Pages expect a list of pages to check whether or not there was a post in a certain year/month/day. This will also provide a bunch of flexibility and multi usage of the partial.

(If you are wondering what (now.Format "2006") makes - have a look at the explanation of dateFormat in Hugo.)

## Taxonomy structure

In order to make working links to the archive we need to create taxonomies that creates the list-pages for the articles. For this we need changes in the hugo.toml and prepare some layouts for the archive-taxonomy.

**hugo.toml**

```
# adding taxonomy term 'archive'
[taxonomies]
archive = "archive"
```

Then create a layout file called archive.html in /layouts/taxonomy/. To start with the following content:

**archive.html**

```
<h1>Archive! Hooray...</h1>
{{ $currentTaxonomy := index (last 1 (split (delimit (split .URL "/") "," "") ",")) 0 }}
{{ .Pages | jsonify }}
```

Next choose a page you want to be rendered within the activity calendar-view and add the following front matter:

**your-content.md**

```
+++
date = "2017-03-06T21:27:05.454Z"
PublishDate = "2017-03-06T21:27:05.454Z"
archive = ["2017","2017-03","2017-03-06"]
+++
```

Unclear whether PublishDate is required...

In this example the page will be rendered in the archive of the Year 2017, the month of March and within the specific dayâ€™s archive at the 6th of March, 2017.
