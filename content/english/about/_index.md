### About

EOC.Online's goal is to provide insights & resources for your emergency operations center. Whether yours is small or large, private or public, we aim to offer a flexible, extensible, secure set of options that can be customized for your Emergency Operations Center's needs. Our software is based on free, open source, robust code that runs on a laptop, a server farm, or in the cloud. Transform your EOC operations from chaotic to focused!

eoc.online was created by [John Cornelison](/authors/john-cornelison/) of Vashon, Washington, but the goal is to expand the number of contributors and thus ensure we provide current information on a range of relevant topics.

John served as Deputy Manager for the Vashon EOC for nearly a decade and has volunteered with them as Planning Section Chief and in other roles for nearly 20 years, working closely with Vashon Island Fire & Rescue, King County Office of Emergency management and even the Washington State Office of Emergency Management and FEMA during that time. Founding President of VashonBePrepared during its initial five years, John then served on the board, often as an officer, for another decade after that. He also is a software architect with a background in Healthcare IT.

### Open Source, Standards Based Insights and Resources for Emergency Operations Centers

We initially started working on open source, free websites to serve as a template for your community's Emergency Operations Center's use, and that's still an eventual plan. The goal remains to provide sophisticated tools that simplify your staff and volunteers effort during disasters. Easy navigation and workflows mirror ICS & NIMS guidance for typical EOCs. Each community is encouraged to customize their own software and public outreach to match local risks, special populations, and other circumstances.
