eoc.online™ provides free tools for Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) and local ACS/ARES/CERT/MRC/Neighborhood/Citizen Corps groups. For more information check out https://eoc.online.

## About

EOC.Online's goal is to make it easy for you to install and use a standards based website for your emergency operations center. Whether yours is small or large, private or public, we offer a flexible, extensible, secure set of options customized for your Emergency Operations Center's needs. Our software is based on free, open source, robust code that runs on a laptop, a server farm, or in the cloud. Transform your EOC operations from chaotic to focused!

## Projects

EOC.online currently is working on 3 efforts - with others now archived.

## Open Source, Standards Based Web Sites for Emergency Operations Centers

We started working on open source, free websites to serve as a template for your community's Emergency Operations Center's use. The goal is to provide sophisticated tools that simplify your staff and volunteers effort during disasters. Easy navigation and workflows mirror ICS & NIMS guidance for typical EOCs. Each community is encouraged to customize their own website to match local risks, special populations, and other circumstances.

EOC.online is a flexible, free, toolset for creating your own NIMS/ICS based EOC website. Set up a usable, working web site in minutes, and then customize it based on your community experience in the years ahead!

### RangerTrak™

"Track & map search & rescue members reporting via radio, without reliable cell or internet access"

The RangerTrak™ application aids tracking & mapping CERT, ACS, wildland firefighters & other teams, 'rangers' & individuals roaming around, who are only reliably connected via HAM radio or other non-data supporting means. Teams or individuals can radio in their locations - in a variety of formats, and be centrally tracked. A single log of reports, locations, events and time is created for documentation and analysis. Most critically search area coverage can be determined and teams/individuals that have NOT reported in can be monitored.

This Progressive Web Application, or PWA, will largely run even if there is inconsistent, limited, or no cell, internet or data access at the command post. It runs entirely in a device's browser, allowing operation on most any simple, modern, basic web brower in the field. Rangers can radio in their locations - using a variety of location codes, and be centrally tracked.

Verbally transmitting & transcribing latitude & longitude coordinates can be very error prone and slow. Instead RangerTrak also permits other ways to report locations: by Street Address, Google PlusCodes, and perhaps What3Words. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Location_Code#Other_geocode_systems for a list.

### OpenFemaNgClient™

"A TypeScript & Angular Client for the openFEMA datasets/APIs"

FEMA has released a wide variety of data for public use over the last decade. Their OpenFEMA project provides extensive, historic disaster-related data. It is well documented at: https://www.fema.gov/about/reports-and-data/openfema. However there are not many samples illustrating ways to display and analyze the data without advanced programming skills.

OpenFemaNgClient is an Angular (i.e., 'Ng') and Typescript application that provides one such sample approach for accessing a few of these data sets with ubiqitious JavaScript. Initially this is a proof of concept, with encouragement it could be fortified into an enterprise ready tool!
