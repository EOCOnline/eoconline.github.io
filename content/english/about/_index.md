## About

EOC.Online's goal is to provide insights & resources for your emergency operations center. Whether yours is small or large, private or public, we offer a flexible, extensible, secure set of options customized for your Emergency Operations Center's needs. Our software is based on free, open source, robust code that runs on a laptop, a server farm, or in the cloud. Transform your EOC operations from chaotic to focused!

## Open Source, Standards Based Insights and Resources for Emergency Operations Centers

We initially started working on open source, free websites to serve as a template for your community's Emergency Operations Center's use. The goal remains to provide sophisticated tools that simplify your staff and volunteers effort during disasters. Easy navigation and workflows mirror ICS & NIMS guidance for typical EOCs. Each community is encouraged to customize their own software and public outreach to match local risks, special populations, and other circumstances.
