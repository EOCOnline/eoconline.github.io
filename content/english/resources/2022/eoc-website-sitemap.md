## Content Ideas for an EOC website

> Have you considered these topics for inclusion into your Emergency Operations Center's website? Hopefully these can inspire some discussions about how to build your own website - for the public, your partners, and your staff and volunteers!

This is quite an exhaustive listing of topics and pages that may or _may not_ reflect your community needs and messaging goals. Consider the ongoing upkeep effort - and readership's enthusiasm - before planning a vast site that may duplicate others in your region.

## Self-Assess, Before Plowing In

For new and smaller EOC's it is recommended to avoid recreating all the following content if it only mirrors that of your local county or state website.

As an alternative approach, it can be very effective to have a few pages pertaining to local organizations, contacts, and planning efforts, but to let another organization (with sufficient budget and staffing) handle the primary and ongoing messaging.

Having a unified message is most critical to reassure citizens and organizations. If you do not anticipate having public relations staffing during serious events then consider coordinating with your parent organizations for handling your messaging too. Certainly clarify ahead of time your various roles in different scenerios!

### Public Pages

- Home Page

  - Welcome message identifying intended audience and website purpose
  - Brief introduction with your purpose and authority
  - Navigation to the rest of the site
  - Latest news and rotating content
  - Links to other websites for official emergency news and content (National Weather Service, InciWeb, State Emergency Division, etc.)
  - Login for website authoring

- Temporal Information (i.e., blog)
  Blogs are a great way to get out current emergency information. People understand them and form a habit of reviewing them, often subscribe for updates, and can easily search for older news postsin a chronological fashion.

(We do NOT recommend having a different site or page dedicated to emergency information. It confuses readers when they can least handle it, and creates problems as incidents cycle through various phases and during multiple overlapping emergencies.)

- "Timeless" information that only changes slowly over time, and is generally applicable.

  - Why Prepare, i.e., Hazards
    Ideally this matches and reflects your community [THIRA](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/national-preparedness/goal/risk-capability-assessment), optionally with specific pages one your key risks, presenting current science and mitigation measures that can be taken.
