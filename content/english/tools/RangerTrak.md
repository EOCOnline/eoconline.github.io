RangerTrak™

> Track & map search & rescue members reporting via radio, without reliable cell or internet access

The RangerTrak™ application aids tracking & mapping CERT, ACS, wildland firefighters & other teams, ‘rangers’ & individuals roaming around, who are only reliably connected via HAM radio or other non-data supporting means. Teams or individuals can radio in their locations - in a variety of formats, and be centrally tracked. A single log of reports, locations, events and time is created for documentation and analysis. Most critically search area coverage can be determined and teams/individuals that have NOT reported in can be monitored.

This Progressive Web Application, or PWA, will largely run even if there is inconsistent, limited, or no cell, internet or data access at the command post. It runs entirely in a device’s browser, allowing operation on most any simple, modern, basic web brower in the field. Rangers can radio in their locations - using a variety of location codes, and be centrally tracked.

Verbally transmitting & transcribing latitude & longitude coordinates can be very error prone and slow. Instead RangerTrak also permits other ways to report locations: by Street Address, Google PlusCodes, and perhaps What3Words. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Location_Code#Other_geocode_systems for a list.
