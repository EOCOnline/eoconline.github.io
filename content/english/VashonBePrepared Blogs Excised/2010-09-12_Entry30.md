<p><img title="This winter's extra snowfall prediction" border="0" alt="This winter's extra snowfall prediction" align="right" style="display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_vgawnhRg_KY/TIkCzZBt0kI/AAAAAAAADFs/BzuYBPxWe-4/s400/JFMsnow.JPG" /><font color="#6f6f6f" size="2"><em><strong>Cliff Mass’ long-term forecast points to a cold and wet winter ahead</strong></em></font></p>
<p>“There is a strong correlation between the temperature of the tropical Pacific and the general character of our weather”</p>
<p>The fall is forecast to be significantly wetter than normal and the winter somewhat so. Fall temperatures are predicted to be normal, but the winter should be cooler than normal.</p>
<p>While the mountains will have the heaviest snows, more than average is forecast for our lowlands too.</p>

<p>Deals on ski area passes have another week or two to run, so don’t delay!</p>
