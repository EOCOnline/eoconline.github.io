I’ve also updated the <a target="_blank" href="http://dnnwiki.codeplex.com/releases/view/63474">Wiki module</a> to 4.3.0 (alpha), and the <a target="_blank" href="http://dnnlinks.codeplex.com/releases/view/63632">Links module</a> to 6.0.0 beta, and <a target="_blank" href="http://dnnforum.codeplex.com/releases/view/59215">Forum module</a> to 5.0.1. <a target="_blank" href="http://wnslightbox.codeplex.com/">Lightbox Gallery</a> has is a new install allowing FancyBox display of images. Unfortunately I’ve had to uninstall the effority.UserDirectory for now due to <a target="_blank" href="http://userdirectory.codeplex.com/workitem/7963">this issue</a>, but a reinstall may solve this. To provide support for IE9, the Telerik controls have been updated to their Q1 2011 release, per <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dotnetnuke.com/Resources/Blogs/tabid/825/EntryId/3031/DotNetNuke-Telerik-and-IE9.aspx">Joe Brinkman’s guidance</a>.&#160; The wiki upgrade in particular should allow us to finally clear up those extraneous pages with funky characters – that prevented their deletion or even editing – but actually completely broke functionality for now. I anticipate the wiki will be back up in the next week or so…as I’m having a discussion with the developer on this. [UPDATE: The solution arrived yesterday (Monday) and the wiki is now back up – and improved!]</p>
