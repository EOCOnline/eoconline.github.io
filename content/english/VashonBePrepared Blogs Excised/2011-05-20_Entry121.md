We added them about a month ago to our list of key partners (see list with their logos on our <a target="_blank" href="/">home page</a>), in recognition of their vital role in the island’s disaster preparedness and response roles.</p>
<p>In reality, the VISD have long been an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vashonbeprepared.org/storylist.cfm?name=news#growingup">informal partner</a>, through their participation in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vashonbeprepared.org/storylist.cfm?name=news#viemacreation">VIEMA</a>, their advanced work in disaster preparedness (Donna Donnelly, Assistant to Superintendent Michael Soltman, conducted extensive preparedness training in the late 1990s and authored VISD’s disaster plan) &amp; they’ve held numerous drills since.</p>
<p>More recently though, Donna Donnelly has joined VashonBePrepared’s board of directors and now even serves as our Treasurer.</p>
<p>As Fire Chief Hank Lipe mentioned in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/vashon/vib/news/122042968.html">latest <em>Beachcomber</em></a>, a memorandum of understanding is being drafted between <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/safety/prepare.aspx">King County’s Office of Emergency Management</a> and VISD which recognizes the School District’s potential role to serve as a center for disaster recovery efforts in the initial days after a major earthquake - if it makes sense to all at the time. This MOU formalizes VISD’s potential role, so that reimbursements can readily flow to VISD for such a purpose. (Being a center for disaster recovery efforts isn’t part of VISD’s formal mission – so having this MOU will alleviate potential issues an auditor might have.) The MOU also notes VIFR and VashonBePrepared’s overall coordination roles in island disaster preparedness efforts.</p>
<p>VashonBePrepared recognizes the value of our schools in educating our future generations and the broad outreach they enjoy to island families: we’re proud to partner with them!</p>
