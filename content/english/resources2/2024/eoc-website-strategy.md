## Developing an EOC Website Strategy

Does your Emergency Operations Center have a communication strategy? Likely so, but does that include internal, private communications, as well as public media?

Maybe your needs are simple, but ideally, you've made that decision consciously - not just accepting the status quo.

Innate challenges to emergency management include

- disasters have huge societal, financial & ecological impacts that can last for years,
- staffing typically includes employees or volunteers who often have other primary duties,
- the intermittent nature of disasters,
- intense, long, and inconvenient work shifts,
- personnel turnover, &
- cost of training.

These all mean a premium should be put on checklists, job aides, just-in-time/on-site training, and consistent but simple job descriptions -- anything to streamline workers' productivity in an incident.

An internal website (or Intranet) can be a useful tool for documenting this and even actively helping administer the incident. Streamlining this area of operations can provide huge value.

If you think we're looking at WebEOC or VEOCI, those are great - and getting better - but certainly do not cover the bases in terms of what an EOC needs to do, or managing an incident properly.

Here's one approach for creating a strategy for right-sizing your internal EOC website. Future articles will cover specific aspects of making your website work for you.

#### Step 1: Document what Exists

There's no need to reinvent the wheel, so start by documenting, at a high level, what hard-copy & electronic materials exist, where they are kept, and if there are any associated policies or procedures.

Clarify issues that need to change with a future system:

- dependent on Internet access
- hard to edit & maintain
- not used, or only inconsistently so
- no convenient read/write permission mechanism for groups
- lack of a workflow for drafting, approving, and publishing
- no automation for form processing or other automated activities

Can existing systems be tuned and improved - and how - or is it time to start afresh? What do others think?

#### Step 2: Determine the Opportunity

Brainstorming possibilities encourages others to provide input and for the team to get excited about what could be done.

> Refining or developing an agile website for an Emergency Operations Center need not be a huge expense, but it certainly can be and the opportunity cost (i.e., other projects that would be displaced by this one) should be carefully weighed.

Consider how the following EOC tasks get handled in your organization and what role a website, or application, could have. Is your current system working or could it be revamped? This review should focus on functionality - not a specific structure or how these are to be accomplished.

- Public Interface

  - How to prepare (citizens, businesses, neighbors, visitors, etc.)
  - Where to get emergency notifications - whatever your language
  - How to reach us
  - About us - mission, authorization, staffing

- Human Relations (HR) or Planning's Resource Unit as appropriate

  - Policies & Procedures reference
  - On-boarding
    - Organizational Overview
    - DEI
    - Reimbursement policies
  - Guide to electronic systems & office equipment
  - Staff & volunteer directories: Contact lists
  - Credentialing & task books
  - Training records & opportunities
  - Hours worked/volunteered records
  - Travel to/from incident
  - Staffing plans (for current & future op periods)

- Incident Management. For each current/old incident:
  Per Operational Period:

  - Objectives
  - Incident Action Plan
  - Planning Clock/Battle Rhythm
  - Paper and electronic records (Documentation Unit)
  - Message/Call log (for formal communications, i.e., assignments, resource orders, etc.)
  - ICS-214 Activity Logs - Personal or Unit
    -

  General

  - Blank ICS forms

- Reference Library

  - Document Library - Your organization likely has an existing solution for file storage such as SharePoint, OneDrive, Google Docs, or Dropbox. Unfortunately, those solutions oft have sparse granular security and workflow features.
  - WIki -

- Are there opportunities to organize it better?

This is quite an exhaustive listing of topics and pages that may or _may not_ reflect your community needs and messaging goals. Consider the ongoing upkeep effort - and the readership's enthusiasm - before planning a vast site that may duplicate others in your organization - or region.

Many topics may require a sentence/paragraph to cover - not a page!

Much of this may be covered by ongoing training and other standard departmental HR sessions, but it is worth having _some_ resource section that spells all these details out, and points to where the answers are, whether on this website or another.

The main categories are broken up by possible audiences. These different segments may be on different websites or -- by requiring logins to view (or even edit) non-public content -- all on one unified website. Your environment will dictate your options.

If you have website technology that allows logging in a assigning roles easily, you can control who can see, or even edit, various pages or sections of your website. That requires creating & managing usernames and logins, requiring time & effort.

#### Step 3: Set a Realistic Plan

> Self-Assess, Before Plowing In!

While a grand plan is fine, be sure to phase things so you only tackle achievable goals and use an agile methodology to proceed: a bite at a time. Especially if you are creating something new, you'll need to get buy-in, chose technology. Frankly, this isn't likely to be fast or cheap: financially or hour-wise.

For new and smaller EOC's it is recommended to avoid recreating all the following content if it only mirrors that of your local county or state website.

As an alternative approach, it can be very effective to have a few pages pertaining to local organizations, contacts, and planning efforts, but to let another organization (with sufficient budget and staffing) handle the primary and ongoing messaging.

Having a unified message is most critical to reassure citizens and organizations. If you do not anticipate having public relations staffing during serious events then consider coordinating with your parent organizations for handling your messaging too. Certainly clarify ahead of time your various roles in different scenarios!
