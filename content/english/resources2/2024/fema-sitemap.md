Exploring a bit, I realized that the official FEMA.gov website is huge, and has so many branches and leafs, that it is neigh impossible to fully grasp even its main sections. Its just too big!

So, I've created a sitemap (as of 21 September 2024 anyway) for their site that allows one to contract and expand branches depending on what you're looking for.

### What's a SiteMap?

As noted [here](./eoc-sitemap.md),

_"Technically, a sitemap is a plain text file (albeit with a [special format](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview)) that lists pages in your website that you want search engines to crawl and add to their results database._

_"A sitemap can also be used to quickly outline your (current or planned) website. Being abstract, it is easy to move or rearrange a website's structure for discussion purposes. It can be represented as a mindmap, but for our purposes a basic outline of pages will suffice. Each line of the outline could be a main menu heading, a section, a page, or even a portion of a page._

### FEMA.gov Sitemap Visualized

The FEMA site is mammoth, and like eating an elephant its best to proceed a bit at a time.
