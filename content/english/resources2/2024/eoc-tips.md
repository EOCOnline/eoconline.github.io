## EOC Tips

### Consistent On-boarding

- Staff, volunteers, and outside users of your EOC need a single source of truth, policies, procedures, and resources to work efficiently under pressure, as a team. Document this, ensure new personnel get a copy and refresh this as needed.
- Avoid derivatives.
- Ensure personnel have this information available whether at their normal jobs, at home, a command post, or in the EOC. An on-line copy combined with a thumb drive might work, depending on your security protocols.

### Project Management

- Does your EOC have a Continuous Improvement list?
- Use a form of ticket tracking for future, open & completed projects, even if just a spreadsheet.
- SMART Objectives https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria
- Consider Project management Software to run (especially) long-running activations
- Tie all Incident Objectives to the Incident Action Plan's Missions/Tasks/Strategies & 204sâ€¦
- Ensure all meetings end up with clear action items for the future, reflecting meeting decisions. Record these in an ongoing project list. (Meetings, training and exercises should all result in action items. "If its not documented it didn't happen!"

### Organization Building

- Provide time during general EOC trainings and meetings for Section (even Unit) specific discussions. This will build those teams & allow refinements to their work flows.
