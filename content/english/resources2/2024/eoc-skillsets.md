FEMAâ€™s list of Skillsets (& associated Skills/Tasks) help Emergency Operation Centers (EOCs) qualify personnel. Common Skillsets suggest training & provide a standardized vocabulary to specify personnel skills between EOCs. This repository contains derivative products of the FEMA skillsets to aid in their effective use.

This lists of all the current Skillsets, Skills and Tasks in one place, easy to morph into whatever format you desire. We'll likely provide Excel, Google Sheet, and JSON versions to begin with.
