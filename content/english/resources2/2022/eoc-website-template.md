## Content Ideas for an EOC website

> Content Ideas for an EOC website

This open source, free website is a template for your community's Emergency Operations Center's use. The goal is to provide sophisticated tools that simplify your staff and volunteers effort during disasters. Easy navigation and workflows mirror ICS & NIMS guidance for typical EOCs. Each community is encouraged to customize their own website to match local risks, special populations, and other circumstances.

EOC.online is a flexible, free, toolset for creating your own NIMS/ICS based EOC website. Set up a usable, working web site in minutes, and then customize it based on your community experience in the years ahead!
