<p>Copies of the Log Summary Page from the 24Oct09 Blizzard Exercise have been posted (and subsequently moved to the Document Exchange - under Planning |&#160;Msg&#160;Ctr | Incident Specific Docs -&#160;that only registered EOC&#160;volunteers can access). Use the .MHT file if you are on Windows, as it has a couple (minor) embedded graphics files - which won't show up on the .HTM version.</p>
<p>Do note that links on either page won't work - at least not outside VIFR's firewall, and likely not unless you are on one the VashonEOC computers.</p>
