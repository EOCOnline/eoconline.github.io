## Hay Bailer Process

>   For wildfires, Logistics & Plan’s Resource Unit often uses what is called a Hay Bailer Process that may be useful for all-hazard EOC operations.

>   Use the poor man’s TCards: Post-it notes!

Use an ICS-215 form to define commonly ordered sets of resources:   
e.g., “LEO (Law Enforcement Officer) Strike Team is defined as 1 lead unit + 5 police, each with their own car”

This might use formal FEMA Typing in form 204 – or not

Physical or electronic Board

-   As explained during my 962 All-Hazards Planning Section Chief Course on May 3-5, 2023 led by Scott Koller
