Quick EOC Tips

-   EOC Tip
-   Does your EOC have a Continuous Improvement list?
-   Have you had extensive meetings only to have no action items at the end, so all that work is a rapidly shrinking memory in a week?
-   SMART Objectives
-   Consider Project management Software to run (especially) long-running activations
-   Have ties between your Incident Objectives and your actual Missions/Tasks/Strategies & 204sâ€¦
-   Encourage Sectional (even Unit) meetings, not just EOC meetings. Builds teams. Set aside 10 minutes at the start of training.
