Emergency Preparedness &amp; Response:<br />
<br />
A Half Day Basic Class on February 4 ... OR ...A 45-hour Course Packed With Skills <br />
<br />
Participation in CERT is highly rewarding for both you and your neighbors. If community support when problems arise is important to you, CERT will likely be an extraordinarily positive experience. &nbsp;CERT originated in Los Angeles in 1994 to support the city fire department, and has been enhanced and extended to hundreds of communities by FEMA to help citizens safely help each other in various emergencies. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The rewards are:<br />
<br />
Increased safety at your home &amp; businessIncreased personal preparedness for windstorms, earthquakes and power outages&nbsp;New life-saving and first aid skillsIncreased self-confidence New friendsParticipation in the Vashon communityStylish green hard-hat and hi-vis vest (for team) <br />
