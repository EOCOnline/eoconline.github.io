Upcoming CERT classes, starting February 27th!<br />
<br />
This is an every-other-year opportunity to be trained by arguably the best Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) program in the country. Vashon CERT provides about 40 hours of training in all aspects of emergency response. It is the only team in the region that operates as a fully-contained Search and Rescue (SAR) unit, under the auspices of Vashon Island Fire and Rescue (VIFR). Folks who complete the class and maintain their skills may become REWs (Registered Emergency Workers). There are lots of opportunities to specialize within CERT: for instance, many CERT members are now licensed for ham radio, and a new Equestrian CERT has formed to help in rural SAR efforts. If you&rsquo;ve been considering upping your preparedness game, this is well worth your time!<br />
