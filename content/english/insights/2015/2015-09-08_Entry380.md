<p><em>AlertSeattle</em> is a free service that allows you to sign up online to receive customized alerts via text message, email, voice message, and on social media (Facebook and Twitter). This service is provided by the City of Seattle at no cost; however, message and data rates may apply.</p>
<p>In addition to emergency alerts, you can also choose to receive customizable community notifications. These will include notifications about severe weather, safety, health, utility disruptions, major traffic incidents, and more. </p>
<p>Enrolling in <em>AlertSeattle</em> is simple:</p>
<p>1. Go to <a href="http://alert.seattle.gov/">alert.seattle.gov</a></p>
<p>2. Register your information</p>
<p>3. Tell them how to reach you (via text message, email or voice message) </p>
<p>4. Select the types of alerts you want to receive</p>
<p>5. Receive alerts and stay informed!</p>
<p>Follow AlertSeattle on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/alertseattle">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/alertseattle">Twitter</a> too!</p>
<p>Your information is private and will not be used or distributed in any manner. This system is available to anyone who lives, works, travels through or visits Seattle. For more, go to: <a href="http://alert.seattle.gov/">alert.seattle.gov</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Stay Informed with <em>Alert<span style="font-size: 18px;">Vashon</span></em>!</strong></p>
<p>Of course the primary alert system to pay attention to is Voice of Vashon&rsquo;s Emergency Alert System &ndash; which (of course!) preceded Seattle&rsquo;s by many months. (Way to go, to those VoV volunteers!)</p>
