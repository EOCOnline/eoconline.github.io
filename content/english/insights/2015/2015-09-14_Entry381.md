<p style="text-align: left;">I'm excited to share about a lecture in VAA's upcoming Science series, featuring Professor John Vidale from the University of Washington.&nbsp; Vidale is our state seismologist, and in his role as director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, he's also leading in the creation of the new Cascadia earthquake early warning system. We're very lucky to have this seismology rockstar coming to Vashon!</p>

<p>Our next major earthquake might be a century from now or much sooner, as detailed in the frightening New Yorker article that has received sensational international press. The technology will exist soon to warn people seconds to minutes before the worst shaking. The Pacific Northwest Seismic Network is exploring the benefits and cost of such an earthquake early warning system, with the aim to get it working in the next few years. Professor John&nbsp;Vidale&nbsp;will review the earthquake and volcano hazards and the latest geoscience of the Pacific Northwest as he explains the next steps in our preparations for &ldquo;the big ones&rdquo;. Vidale&nbsp;is a Professor at the University of Washington, Director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network, and the Washington State Seismologist.&nbsp; He has previously worked with the U.S. Geological Survey, and served as director of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at UCLA. His research focuses on earthquakes, volcanoes, Earth structure, and the hazards of strong shaking.</p>
