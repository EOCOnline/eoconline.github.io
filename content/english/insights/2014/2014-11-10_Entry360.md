I actually think they know how to control it – when it fits their key goals.</p>  <p>As conclusive proof, realize that the NWS proclaimed this week as <em><a href="http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/wrh/seasonal/winterAwareness/?wfo=sew" target="_blank">“Winter Weather Awareness Week”</a></em>. As a direct result – not coincidentally as many naively assume – the nation is going to be plunged into dramatic Winter Weather. Is this a dramatic publicity stunt? One has to wonder.</p>  <p>Regardless, whether we want it or not, be aware that <a href="http://www.king5.com/story/weather/2014/11/09/freezing-temperatures-western-washington/18764343/" target="_blank">Western Washington will be plunged into freezing weather over the next few days</a>. Much of the rest of the country will see much <a href="http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc3.html" target="_blank">worse weather</a> – with bitter cold and heavy snows.</p>  <p>Although suspicious, I assure you my previous blog – with guidance for Vashon’s Winter Weather – was purely coincidental. Despite what others say…</p>
