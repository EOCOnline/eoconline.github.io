"Eighty-four percent of the landslides that have happened in Seattle have, to some minor or major degree, human activity involved," according to Seattle Office of Emergency Management Director Barb Graff.

Big factors cited in the KOMO piece were:

- People removing soil from the slopeâ€™s base ("toe")
- Modifying (removing) hillside vegetation
- Introducing water (rain or other runoff) onto/into a slope
