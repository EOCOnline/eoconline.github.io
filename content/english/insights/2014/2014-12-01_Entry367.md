<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline" src="http://revoseek.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/iOS-5-Beta-Pre-Earthquake-Warning-Feature-in-iPhones.jpg" width="500" align="right" height="333" />According to the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-1123-earthquake-early-warning-20141123-story.html" target="_blank">LA Times</a>, the entire west coast should get access to the first generation of early earthquake warnings as early as next year. Dependent on congress’ upcoming vote, the budget would be some $16 million annually.</p>  <p>The new system would be the first generation, after a bare-bones prototype system has proven the concept over the last year or so in a limited set of locations. California would go from 200 to 400 sensors while 275 sensors are apparently all that are currently planned for Oregon and Washington.</p>  <p>Specialized systems have been in place for years. For instance the Alaskan Way Viaduct automatically is closed on an <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Projects/SR99/ViaductClosureSystem/default.htm" target="_blank">early warning system</a> installed in June 2011.</p>  <p>Based on a distributed set of sensors, the warnings travel at nearly the speed of light - while the seismic waves travel closer to the speed of sound. That adds up to a minute of advance warning for locations 150 miles away from the epicenter, and even 5 seconds of advance warnings allows elevators to brake, fire departments to open their doors, and other automated systems to kick in – potentially saving hundreds of millions through out a region.</p>
