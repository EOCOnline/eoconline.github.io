One of their latest - Monster Guard: Prepare for Emergencies - is oriented at 7-11 year olds (the first to focus on this special age group) and offers them 15 different episodes – which they can play as one of 5 different characters. Kids gain practice for dealing with house fires, earthquakes, tornadoes, and other dangers. Numerous challenges test children’s skills and encourage them to know these key situations.

While this app appeals mainly to this age group – there are a host of other apps. Check our their full list of [Red Cross Mobile Apps](http://www.redcross.org/prepare/mobile-apps)!
