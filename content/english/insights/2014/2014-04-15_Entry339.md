[![4-15-2014 at 8.46.16 AM](./images/339/f2d4357536a8_637E-4-15-2014_at_8.46.16_AM_thumb.jpg "4-15-2014 at 8.46.16 AM")](./images/339/f2d4357536a8_637E-4-15-2014_at_8.46.16_AM_2.jpg)Somewhat serendipitously, the New York Times Retro Report has come out with a special report on earthquake preparedness published April 13th – the same month as the Pacific Northwest’s 1949 and 1965 earthquakes.

They prepared an 11 minute video that unfortunately focuses mostly on California and Oregon – but hopefully will spur us all to action. California and the Pacific Northwest are clearly not yet adequately prepared for the Big One.

For ideas on how to Get Ready, check out our page at [www.VashonBePrepared.org/AreYouReady.aspx](http://www.VashonBePrepared.org/AreYouReady.aspx) – Seattle’s w[ww.seattle.gov/emergency](http://www.seattle.gov/emergency) or King County’s [www.kingcounty.gov/safety/prepare.aspx](http://www.kingcounty.gov/safety/prepare.aspx).
