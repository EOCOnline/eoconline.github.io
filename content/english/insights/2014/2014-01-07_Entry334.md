Last year, the most expensive weather disasters were in Europe, which included floods in central Europe and hailstorms in Germany.” (USA Today)

Globally, losses from natural catastrophes in 2013 were somewhat more moderate: the direct overall losses of around US$ 125bn and insured losses of around US$ 31bn remained below the average figures of the past ten years (US$ 184bn and US$ 56bn). Regrettably, in a total of 880 natural catastrophes (average of the past ten years: 790), more than 20,000 people were killed. This meant that the death toll was higher than in 2012, but significantly below the average of the past ten years (106,000).

Based on the final graphic here, I wonder if the cost of the disasters is borne by those producing the most greenhouse gases?!
