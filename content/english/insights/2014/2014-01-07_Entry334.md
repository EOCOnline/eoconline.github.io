Last year, the most expensive weather disasters were in Europe, which included floods in central Europe and hailstorms in Germany.” (USA Today)</p>  <p>Globally, losses from natural catastrophes in 2013 were somewhat more moderate: the direct overall losses of around US$ 125bn and insured losses of around US$ 31bn remained below the average figures of the past ten years (US$ 184bn and US$ 56bn). Regrettably, in a total of 880 natural catastrophes (average of the past ten years: 790), more than 20,000 people were killed. This meant that the death toll was higher than in 2012, but significantly below the average of the past ten years (106,000). </p>  <p><a href="./images/334/Windows-Live-Writer-2013-Disasters-not-so-expensive-for-the-_6B88-natural-catastrophes-2013-wold-map_en_Page_3_2.jpg"><img title="natural-catastrophes-2013-wold-map_en_Page_3" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: left; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="natural-catastrophes-2013-wold-map_en_Page_3" src="./images/334/Windows-Live-Writer-2013-Disasters-not-so-expensive-for-the-_6B88-natural-catastrophes-2013-wold-map_en_Page_3_thumb.jpg" width="470" align="left" height="266" /></a>&quot;Nowhere in the world is the rising number of natural catastrophes more evident than in North America, where the number of weather-related loss events has almost quintupled over the past three decades.” (USA Today)</p>  <p>Based on the final graphic here, I wonder if the cost of the disasters is borne by those producing the most greenhouse gases?!</p>  <p><a href="./images/334/Windows-Live-Writer-2013-Disasters-not-so-expensive-for-the-_6B88-natural-catastrophes-2013-wold-map_en_Page_5_2.jpg"><img title="natural-catastrophes-2013-wold-map_en_Page_5" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="natural-catastrophes-2013-wold-map_en_Page_5" src="./images/334/Windows-Live-Writer-2013-Disasters-not-so-expensive-for-the-_6B88-natural-catastrophes-2013-wold-map_en_Page_5_thumb.jpg" width="620" height="351" /></a>&#160;</p>  <p align="right">- Full Story: <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2014/01/07/global-natural-disasters/4342043/">www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2014/01/07/global-natural-disasters/4342043/</a></p>  <p align="right">- Press release &amp; graphics: <a title="http://www.munichre.com/en/media_relations/press_releases/2014/2014_01_07_press_release.aspx" href="http://www.munichre.com/en/media_relations/press_releases/2014/2014_01_07_press_release.aspx">www.munichre.com/en/media_relations/press_releases/2014/2014_01_07_press_release.aspx</a></p>
