Neighborhood preparedness begins at home - and in the car, because we never know where we'll be when things get interesting. I saw a post from WSDOT this morning on Facebook that seems worth sharing - over the weekend, the passes got some harsher weather than expected. Click on the link below to view and print the Winter Driving Supply Checklist. I'm going to see how many items I can check off that are already in the back of my car - wish me luck. How did you do?
