<p><em>Seattle to host Nov. 18th Twitter event to take questions about landslides<strong></strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Seattle_-_1916_landslide_near_Duwamish_Head.gif" target="_blank"><img src="/Portals/1/Uploads/Graphics/Website/Blog/Wikipedia-1916_Landslide_near_Duwamish_Head,_West_Seattle.gif" style="width: 426px; height: 326px; float: right; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 5px;" alt="1916_Landslide_near_Duwamish_Head,_West_Seattle" title="Wikipedias image of 1916 Landslide near Duwamish Head, West Seattle" /></a>Did you know that most landslides occur between the months of October and April? And that 86 percent of landslides are caused to some extent by human activity? Landslide season is upon us and the City of Seattle is urging residents to take preventive measures to protect themselves and their property from possible landslides. </p>
<p>Heavy rains are likely this year for the Pacific Northwest. As the rainfall continues to increase throughout the fall, the threat of landslides will continue to rise in the winter. Experts agree there is no one single factor that contributes to landslides in the area. However, in most cases there are steps that property owners can take to reduce that risk. </p>
<p>With 20,000 Seattle properties, most of which are residential, in landslide-prone areas, DPD encourages property owners to protect themselves from landslides. Learn how by participating in our Twitter Landslide Q&amp;A event and speaking with our landslide expert. </p>
<p><strong>When</strong>: November 18, 12:00 &ndash; 1:00 p.m. </p>
<p><strong>Where</strong>: @SeattleDPD on Twitter </p>
<p>#seattlelandslides</p>
<p>Our Q &amp; A event will give you the opportunity to consult with our landslide expert and learn simple preventive measures that will help protect you from future landslides, such as: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Checking downspouts; making sure they are functioning/routed to a safe location </li>
    <li>Inspecting sloped areas for indications of soil movement and erosion </li>
    <li>Keeping fill and yard waste off slopes </li>
    <li>Shutting off the irrigation system and checking it out seasonally </li>
    <li>Leaving tree stumps in the ground on slopes </li>
    <li>Knowing when to seek professional help for hillside projects </li>
</ul>
<p>Can&rsquo;t participate in the event? Don&rsquo;t worry; we have helpful information you can refer to on our <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/dpd/aboutus/whoweare/emergencymanagement/default.htm">Emergency Management page</a> to let you know if you&rsquo;re at risk and how to be prepared, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Narrated Landslide Presentation </li>
    <li>Interactive GIS Map </li>
    <li>Landslide Prone Area Map</li>
    <li>Dos &amp; Don&rsquo;ts</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a landslide damages your property and you have an immediate concern for your safety, leave the premises and call 9-1-1. Property owners with structures that may be affected by or endangered by a landslide should contact a geotechnical professional for structural evaluation. </p>
