<h3>Thursday, April 24, 2014, 6:00 – 7:00pm</h3>  <h3>UW Science Now</h3>  <h2>Shelley Chestler: Slow Earthquakes</h2>  <h2>Michelle Weirathmueller: Quakes and Whales</h2>  <p>Downstairs at Town Hall; enter on Seneca Street. $5. Double Feature!</p>  <p><a href="http://www.townhallseattle.org/uw-science-nowshelley-chestler-slow-earthquakesmichelle-weirathmueller-quakes-and-whales/"><img title="Permalink to UW Science Now -- Shelley Chestler: Slow Earthquakes and Michelle Weirathmueller: Quakes and Whales" alt="seismograph arrow" src="http://www.townhallseattle.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/seismograph-arrow-560x280.jpg" width="560" height="280" /></a></p>  <p>Science</p>  <p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 0px 0px; display: inline" alt="Shelley.Chestler.photo" src="http://www.townhallseattle.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Shelley.Chestler.photo_-198x300.jpg" width="169" align="left" height="255" />Western Washington is due for “<a href="http://www.king5.com/news/environment/seattle-magnitude-9-earthquake-report-228171731.html">The Big One</a>,” an earthquake which could kill thousands. Shelley Chestler, PhD graduate student in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences, says applying lessons from “slow” earthquakes, which happen about every 15 months, can help prevent catastrophe when the next large-scale earthquake strikes.</p>  <p><img style="float: right; display: inline" alt="Afternoon walk" src="http://www.townhallseattle.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/mich_at_toaster-280x300.jpg" width="173" align="right" height="186" />Recording earthquakes could also have an unexpected effect on the endangered fin whale. Michelle Weirathmueller, School of Oceanography graduate student, has been studying fin whale calls that show up in seafloor earthquake recordings to learn about their movements. By shedding light on where fin whales are, these unexpected measurements may be the key to protecting fin whales. She’ll share her research and how it might make a world of difference.</p>  <p><strong>Presented by:</strong> Town Hall and UW’s Engage: The Science Speaker Series, as part of The Seattle Science Lectures, with the University of Washington.

Our state is also due for “<a href="http://www.king5.com/news/environment/seattle-magnitude-9-earthquake-report-228171731.html">The Big One</a>,” an earthquake which could kill up to 10,000 people in Western Washington. When the time comes, how ready will you be? Are you prepared for a large-scale disaster and its aftermath? Dr. Gavin Hayes, Research Geophysicist at the <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/">U.S. Geological Survey’s National Earthquake Information Center</a>, will give insight into mitigating the effects of earthquakes. A trained earthquake responder, he’ll discuss different ways of response and how best to reduce the disastrous effects of earthquakes. Hayes is appearing at Town Hall as part of the <a href="http://www.iris.edu/hq/programs/education_and_outreach/distinguished_lectureship">2014 IRIS/SSA Distinguished Lectureship Series</a>; he is also an Adjunct Faculty Member at the <a href="http://geophysics.mines.edu/">Colorado School of Mines Department of Geophysics</a>.</p>  <p><strong>Presented by:</strong> Town Hall in partnership with the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology and the Seismology Association of America, as part of The Seattle Science Lecture series sponsored by Microsoft.
