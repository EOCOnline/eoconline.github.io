Cliff has run out of space and brewing capacity, and a serious shortage has developed as he has had to turn down keg sales to individuals, Saturday markets and non profit fundraisers in order to service his commercial accounts.

He urges folks to “help make Vashon Beer Prepared” by supporting the campaign. As he notes in his Kickstarter video, part of his sophisticated logic in launching this effort is to ensure Vashon has enough beer in the event of a severe disaster that might cut us off from the mainland breweries.

The campaign ([www.kickstarter.com/projects/623434306/vashon-beer-prepared](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/623434306/vashon-beer-prepared "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/623434306/vashon-beer-prepared")) ends June 30, so don't wait too long to check it out.
