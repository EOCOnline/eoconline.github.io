As he notes in his Kickstarter video, part of his sophisticated logic in launching this effort is to ensure Vashon has enough beer in the event of a severe disaster that might cut us off from the mainland breweries.</p>  <p>The campaign (<a title="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/623434306/vashon-beer-prepared" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/623434306/vashon-beer-prepared">www.kickstarter.com/projects/623434306/vashon-beer-prepared</a>) ends June 30, so don't wait too long to check it out.</p>
