Thus the ground is laid bare of that vegetation and elevation maps – accurate to about half a centimeter – can be mapped by an survey airplane for a 1 kilometer wide swath. (If needed, better resolutions can be achieved by flying at lower elevations and mapping a narrower swath.)</p>  <p>The new mapping will:</p>  <ul>   <li>reveal new areas of slide risks </li>    <li>Possibly clear areas previously thought to be at risk </li>    <li>predict the potential type of slide </li>    <li>suggest likely paths and areas covered by a debris field </li> </ul>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Any new or existing risk areas will get noted on property owners titles, notifying potential buyers of the current status/risk. And such notifications can be unclear and create issues for current land owners – but make entire sense for buyers. See this <a href="http://touch.latimes.com/#section/-1/article/p2p-80115260/" target="_blank">LA Times story</a> for some of the issues when new fault line maps there recently constrained existing and proposed development on previously unknown faults.</p>  <p>The current King County slide risk map can be viewed at:</p>  <p><a href="http://your.kingcounty.gov/dnrp/library/water-and-land/flooding/local-hazard-mitigation-plan-update/landslide-hazard-map.pdf" target="_blank">http://your.kingcounty.gov/dnrp/library/water-and-land/flooding/local-hazard-mitigation-plan-update/landslide-hazard-map.pdf</a>. </p>
