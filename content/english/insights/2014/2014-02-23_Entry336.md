[![VOV.1232x842](./images/336/c9b8c20a1085_52B4-VOV.1232x842_thumb_1.png "VOV.1232x842")](./images/336/c9b8c20a1085_52B4-VOV.1232x842_4.png)Friday February 21, 2014, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved Voice of Vashon’s (VoV) application for an FM radio station – along with over 1000 other low-power FM applicants nationwide.

Fourteen years ago a small group of volunteers dared to dream that Vashon could have its own live radio voice. Now, that dream has come true.

While much of the infrastructure is in place for the station to go live, a new FM transmitter, a new cadre of volunteers, and some $50K is needed to take this the final mile.

VoV’s Emergency Alert System coverage will be much improved with this additional transmitter on FM. The 1650AM bulletins will be repeated on the FM station. The FM broadcasts will not be restricted to Traveler Information (as the AM station is, under their [Travelers' Information Station permit](http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/license.jsp?licKey=2940596&__newWindow=false) - also known as Highway Advisory Radio), so new opportunities for entertainment and music broadcasting will be opened up for this new station – and Vashon.
