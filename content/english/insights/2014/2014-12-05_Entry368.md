Given the right equipment, citizens with a PWS can share their weather data with a number of services who will aggregate the data and help collectively provide better weather forecasts for the region.

Owners also get more accurate trend data for their micro-climate and a chance to learn more about the vagaries of climate science. I for one was frustrated to have a localized NOAA forecast for 39° while snow remained on the ground all day. (It turns out temperatures are measured at face height: 5-6 feet above the ground and so temps may be significantly cooler at the ground.)

Someone else started one on the Old Vashon Highway loop, north of town a few months back. Last week I started transmitting data from my personal site on north Vashon.

While high quality gear can cost $500 to many thousands of dollars, I was able to scrape by on only $80. It seems pretty robust, but only time will tell if it lasts very long!

Check out recommended equipment at these sites:

- [eHams Reviews](http://www.eham.net/reviews/products/64)
- [Weather Underground](http://www.wunderground.com/weatherstation/products.asp)
- [CWOP’s list (at the very bottom of the page)](http://wxqa.com/resources.html "http://wxqa.com/resources.html")

Rather than the more popular Davis or Ambient Weather stations I went to Costco #1 and got the [Acu-Rite Professional Weather Station](http://www.acurite.com/pro-color-digital-weather-station-with-pc-connect-02032.html) for $80. While certainly not professional quality, it does offer a pretty robust set of features for a great price to get started with. (Caveat: I returned my 1st unit as it wouldn’t connect via USB. The 2nd has worked better.)

Most critically it comes with the Acu-Link software which pumps data up to various sites on the internet. I only send data to Weather Underground so far, but may send the data to other sites in the future.

Steve sends his to [www.wunderground.com](http://www.wunderground.com/), [www.pwsweather.com](http://www.pwsweather.com/) and [Weather bug Back yard](http://weather.weatherbug.com/WA/Vashon-weather/weather-station.html?zcode=z5545).

It also looks like many folks send their [weather data](http://info.aprs.net/index.php?title=Weather) AND their location over HAM radio via [APRS](http://aprs.fi/#!addr=Vashon%2C%20Wa). (I only send location – when I bother to move my rig 3 feet closer to the window to get GPS reception!!!)
