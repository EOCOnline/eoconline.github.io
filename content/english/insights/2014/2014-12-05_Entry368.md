Given the right equipment, citizens with a PWS can share their weather data with a number of services who will aggregate the data and help collectively provide better weather forecasts for the region. </p>
<p>Owners also get more accurate trend data for their micro-climate and a chance to learn more about the vagaries of climate science. I for one was frustrated to have a localized NOAA forecast for 39&deg; while snow remained on the ground all day. (It turns out temperatures are measured at face height: 5-6 feet above the ground and so temps may be significantly cooler at the ground.)</p>

Someone else started one on the Old Vashon Highway loop, north of town a few months back. Last week I started transmitting data from my personal site on north Vashon.</p>
<p>While high quality gear can cost $500 to many thousands of dollars, I was able to scrape by on only $80. It seems pretty robust, but only time will tell if it lasts very long! </p>
<p>Check out recommended equipment at these sites:</p>

</ul>
<p>Rather than the more popular Davis or Ambient Weather stations I went to Costco #1 and got the <a href="http://www.acurite.com/pro-color-digital-weather-station-with-pc-connect-02032.html" target="_blank">Acu-Rite Professional Weather Station</a> for $80. While certainly not professional quality, it does offer a pretty robust set of features for a great price to get started with. (Caveat: I returned my 1st unit as it wouldn&rsquo;t connect via USB. The 2nd has worked better.) </p>
<p>Most critically it comes with the Acu-Link software which pumps data up to various sites on the internet. I only send data to Weather Underground so far, but may send the data to other sites in the future.</p>
<p>Steve sends his to <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/">www.wunderground.com</a>, <a href="http://www.pwsweather.com/">www.pwsweather.com</a> and <a href="http://weather.weatherbug.com/WA/Vashon-weather/weather-station.html?zcode=z5545">Weather bug Back yard</a>.</p>
