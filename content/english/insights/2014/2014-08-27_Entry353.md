According to UW’s John Vidale, as reported by [KING-TV](http://www.king5.com/story/news/local/2014/08/25/earthquake-early-warning-washington/14593425/) and [The Seattle Times](http://blogs.seattletimes.com/today/2014/08/california-quake-warning-system-not-in-washington/), getting an early warning system in place for WA would cost some $17 million annually. We’ve a rudimentary system, but that’s seemingly not ready for prime time. It apparently is a priority for California’s legislators, but not (quite yet) ours. Maybe that will change!

More about California’s system – which gave a 10-second notice to the recent Napa quake is available at [CBS](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/experimental-warning-system-gave-10-second-alert-before-quake-hit/).
