This is according to USGS researcher Craig Weaver, as quoted in [today’s Seattle Times article](http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2024598436_seattlefaultxml.html).

Apparently the quake occurred at the intersection of the Seattle Fault and another fault on the Olympic Peninsula. The article also references a [1995 quake near Vashon with magnitude 5](http://www.bssaonline.org/content/86/4/1167.abstract) – which also turned out to be along the Seattle Fault.

The picture to the right (from the [USGS](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/dyfi/events/uw/60881241/us/index.html)) shows who reported feeling Wednesday’s quake.
