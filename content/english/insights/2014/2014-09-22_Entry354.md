This is according to USGS researcher Craig Weaver, as quoted in <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2024598436_seattlefaultxml.html" target="_blank">today’s Seattle Times article</a>.</p>  <p>Apparently the quake occurred at the intersection of the Seattle Fault and another fault on the Olympic Peninsula. The article also references a <a href="http://www.bssaonline.org/content/86/4/1167.abstract" target="_blank">1995 quake near Vashon with magnitude 5</a> – which also turned out to be along the Seattle Fault.</p>  <p>The picture to the right (from the <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/dyfi/events/uw/60881241/us/index.html" target="_blank">USGS</a>) shows who reported feeling Wednesday’s quake.</p>
