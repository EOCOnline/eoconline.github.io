**![Rated24thEmergencyPrepBlog](./images/Rated24thEmergencyPrepBlog.png "Rated24thEmergencyPrepBlog")**VashonBePrepared strives to keep the community informed in many ways, but one that has been maintained since our initial website back around 2005 is our blog.

It’s now been recognized as one of the [“Top 40 Best Emergency Preparedness Blogs” by Feedspot](https://blog.feedspot.com/emergency_preparedness_blogs/), coming in at 24th.

Congratulations to us - but even more to all the other hard-working authors of other blogs, inspiring their respective communities to prepare, mitigate, respond, or rebuild. Also thanks to authors of the studies and reports and news that we are just covering.
