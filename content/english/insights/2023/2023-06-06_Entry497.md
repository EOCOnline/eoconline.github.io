[![King County Fires, 2015-2019](./images/497/King%20County%20Fires%2C%202015-2019.png "King County Fires, 2015-2019")](https://vashonbeprepared.org./images/497/Open-Live-Writer-Washington-State-Fires_86A8-King_County_Fires%2c_2015-2019_2.png)FEMA.gov has lots of info, and I came across their Data Visualization page, and found their summary of fire reporting for the state of Washington was interesting:

- 131,646 fires in Washington State were reported to the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) between 2015 & 2019, over 26 thousand fires a year, or some 72/day.
- 32,566 were from King County, or 6.5K/year: almost 18/day.
