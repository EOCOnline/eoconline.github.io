Effective Thursday June 1st at 0800hrs the King County Fire Chief’s Association, King County Fire Marshals Association and the King County Fire Marshal are implementing a STAGE 1 (burn restrictions) Ban.  This ban specifically relates to yard debris/residential burning.

In response to the increased Fuel Energy Release Rates (ERC), decreased 100-hour fuel moisture content (F100), and anticipated warmer weather conditions the King County Fire Chiefs and the King County Fire Marshals, collectively are implementing a STAGE 1 Burn Ban (burn restrictions).  Recreational Fires, Gas/propane appliances, including grills, pellet smokers and charcoal grills are still permitted.

The King County Fire Chiefs, Fire Marshals and local jurisdictions encourage all residents to burn according to their local jurisdictions requirements and maintain a fire safe environment.  If you have any questions, please contact your local Fire Department.

**Approved Recreational Burn Requirements**: _\*note some jurisdictions require burning permit_

1.  Firewood shall be seasoned and dry.
2.  Be built in a metal or concrete fire pit, such as those typically found in designated campgrounds; and not be used as debris disposal.
3.  Grow no larger than three feet in diameter.
4.  Be in a clear spot free from any vegetation for at least 10 feet in a horizontal direction, including at least 25 feet away from any structure and allow 20-foot vertical clearance from overhanging branches.
5.  Recreational fires shall be always attended by an alert individual and equipment capable of extinguishing the fire with a shovel and a 5-gallon bucket of water or with a connected and charged water hose.
6.  Completely extinguish campfires by pouring water or moist soil in them and stirring with a shovel until all parts are cool to the touch. The use of self-contained camp stoves is encouraged as an alternative.
7.  No burning when winds exceed 15 MPH.
