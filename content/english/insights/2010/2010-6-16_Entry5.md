<p><b><font color="#800000">NOTE: </font></b><font color="#800000">Vashon EOC and CERT volunteers are generally NOT Emergency Responders, so do not attend the following presuming you’ll be ready to jump into action locally! Instead consider this as a way to learn what the professionals will be doing and use the opportunity to learn the proper vocabulary and potential situations that can arise around this type of accident.</font></p>
<p><b>There are openings still available for July/September Emergency Responder Training</b> <br />
<b>The course provides information firefighters, police and other emergency response personnel</b> <b>will find useful </b>when confronted with an incident involving natural gas or high-voltage power-lines. The half-day training session will provide an overview of the properties, equipment and emergency procedures necessary to identify hazards and reduce the risk to people and property. Program format will include classroom instruction using energized high-voltage equipment and video re-enactments of natural gas incidents and response scenarios.
