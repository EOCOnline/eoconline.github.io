Public Health Seattle & King County & the King County Healthcare Coalition will be offering our free **Business Resiliency Workshop for Healthcare Providers** this summer.

Due to the complexities that H1N1 Pandemic presented, and possible flooding of the Green River Valley, we will be focusing the content more closely on preparing, responding and recovering from these events. _Registration is open to all healthcare_ _organizations who provide direct patient care in King County_.

If you have not registered yet, there is still space available! Space is limited, so please register as soon as possible.

The workshop will be held in Shoreline on **June 29 - June 30, 2010.**

Further details will be sent upon registration.

Thank you!

**_King County Healthcare Coalition_**
