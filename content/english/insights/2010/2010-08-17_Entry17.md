_A pair of loud sonic booms heard around the Seattle area shortly before 2 p.m. Tuesday were caused by two F-16 jets, according to Allen Kenitzer, spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration._

A pair of loud sonic booms heard around the Seattle area shortly before 2 p.m. Tuesday were caused by two F-16 jets, according to Allen Kenitzer, spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration.

The F-16s were being "scrambled" because someone flew a plane inside the "temporary flight restrictions" area set up around Boeing Field, he said.

President Obama landed at Boeing Field as part of his tour of Seattle Tuesday, which includes a stop at a bakery, the Westin Hotel, and fundraisers.

The airspace can be restricted for up to a 30-mile radius around an area, and up to 18,000 feet high, according to the notice.
