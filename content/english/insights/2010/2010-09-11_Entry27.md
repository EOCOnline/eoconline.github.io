Historically Vashon has had a few major wildfires:

_[![BoulderCO-4MileCanyonFromPlains](./images/27/WLW-VashonWildfires2_464D-BoulderCO-4MileCanyonFromPlains_3.jpg "BoulderCO-4MileCanyonFromPlains")](http://www.mytowncolorado.com/photo/four-mile-fire-from-lookout?context=album&albumId=2021996%3AAlbum%3A66523 "Photo from Ani Espriella, as published at: www.mytowncolorado.com/photo/albums/four-mile-canyon-fire-user") 1893: in August 1893 a fire began in the logged off area near the present high school where the first saw mill was located.  The fire rages for two days and nights, "nearly a hundred" volunteers "fought desperately against apparently hopeless odds, with shovels and hoes and rakes, to save the new Baptist Church and the Presbyterian Church at Center, and the Fuller store across the street.  With the flames within two hundred yards of Center, the wind shifted to the north on the evening of the second day, allowing fire fighters finally gain control of the fire._
