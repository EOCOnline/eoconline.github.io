<h5><a href="http://recovery.doi.gov/press/us-geological-survey-twitter-earthquake-detector-ted/">U.S. Geological Survey: Twitter Earthquake Detector (TED)</a> reports that <em>“the USGS is developing a system that gathers real-time, earthquake-related messages from the social networking site Twitter and applies place, time, and key word filtering to gather geo-located accounts of shaking. This approach provides rapid first-impression narratives and, potentially, photos from people at the hazard’s location.”</em></h5>
