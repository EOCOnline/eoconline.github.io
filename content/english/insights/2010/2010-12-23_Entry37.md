##### [U.S. Geological Survey: Twitter Earthquake Detector (TED)](http://recovery.doi.gov/press/us-geological-survey-twitter-earthquake-detector-ted/) reports that _“the USGS is developing a system that gathers real-time, earthquake-related messages from the social networking site Twitter and applies place, time, and key word filtering to gather geo-located accounts of shaking. This approach provides rapid first-impression narratives and, potentially, photos from people at the hazard’s location.”_
