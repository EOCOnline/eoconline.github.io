<p><strong>Time:</strong>&#160; 1400 â€“ 1700</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong>&#160; Pt Robinson Lighthouse upper parking lot</p>
<p><strong>Equipment:</strong>&#160; CERT helmet and safety vest.&#160; Long sleeve shirts and long pants with closed toe shoes or boots suitable for uneven terrain.</p>
<p>If you have an FRS, hand-held radio please bring it, if not we will have radios you can borrow. <br />
We have run two of these events before - once in December, it was cold and rainy, but fun.&#160; Once at the end of May, it was heavenly.&#160; We expect this weekend to be very enjoyable and we will learn a lot.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please call Catherine at 463.4558. She can send you the Training Authorization for this Sunday's training.&#160; It contains many details such as time, place, agenda, equipment, communication.</p>
