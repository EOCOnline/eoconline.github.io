<p>In a <i>Report and Order</i> (<i><a href="http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-10-124A1.pdf">R&amp;O</a></i>) released Wednesday, July 14, the FCC stated that under new guidelines, amateurs employed by non-governmental agencies, such as hospitals, may participate and operate in drills sponsored by their employer. Specifically, the FCC will now permit Amateur Radio operators "to transmit messages, under certain limited circumstances, during either government-sponsored or non-government sponsored emergency and disaster preparedness drills, regardless of whether the operators are employees of entities participating in the drill." More information will be posted on the ARRL Web site.</p>
