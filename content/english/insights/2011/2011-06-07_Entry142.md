Jackson Federal Building.&#160;</p>
<p>HAZUS-MH is software developed by FEMA that analyzes risk from natural hazards in communities. To register for this FREE conference, please visit <a href="http://www.hazus.net">www.hazus.net</a>. From their site:</p>
<p>HAZUS-MH is a powerful risk assessment methodology used to analyze potential losses from natural hazards including floods, hurricane winds and earthquakes. HAZUS uses state-of-the-art Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software combined with science, engineering and mathematical modeling to map and display hazard data and the results of damage and economic loss estimates for buildings and infrastructure. <br />
HAZUS-MH was developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under contract with the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS). NIBS gathered the top scientific and engineering minds in the nation to create HAZUS.&#160; <br />
The earthquake model was first released in 1997 followed by a significantly improved HAZUS99, released in 1999. In 2004, HAZUS added flood and wind loss estimation capability, making it a multi-hazard loss estimation tool. Subsequent releases in 2005, 2006 and 2007 have improved HAZUS’ speed and analytical capacity. <br />
Now a seasoned multi-hazard disaster loss simulation tool, HAZUS MR4 gives the nation and communities a window into the future and a means to prioritize activities that will reduce disaster-related losses.</p>
