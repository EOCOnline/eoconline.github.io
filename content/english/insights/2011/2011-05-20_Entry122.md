The announcement was made at an event involving business, education and government leaders at Red Cross national headquarters in Washington DC.&#160; Ready Rating™ is a free, self-paced, web-based membership program that helps a business or school measure how ready they are to deal with emergencies, and gives customized feedback on how they can improve their efforts.&#160; Schools and businesses may face a number of emergencies that could disrupt their operations, ranging from natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods to outbreaks of illness such as the flu. The Ready Rating Program can help them feel more confident about the safety of their employees or students.&#160; See the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.redcross.org/portal/site/en/menuitem.94aae335470e233f6cf911df43181aa0/?vgnextoid=88da7178560ef210VgnVCM10000089f0870aRCRD">ARC press release</a> for more information.</p>
