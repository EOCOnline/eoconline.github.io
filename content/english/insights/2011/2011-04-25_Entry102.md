<blockquote>
<p><em>Know the difference 2B ready RT @</em><a href="http://twitter.com/USGS"><em>USGS</em></a><em>: How much bigger is a 8.7 2A 5.8? Click "Try It Yourself" Calculator at top of </em><a href="http://go.usa.gov/baq"><em>http://go.usa.gov/baq</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As they note on their site, <a title="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/how_much_bigger.php" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/how_much_bigger.php">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/how_much_bigger.php</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The magnitude scale is really comparing amplitudes of waves on a seismogram, not the STRENGTH (energy) of the quakes. So, a magnitude 8.7 is 794 times bigger than a 5.8 quake as measured on seismograms, but the 8.7 quake is about 23,000 times STRONGER than the 5.8! Since it is really the energy or strength that knocks down buildings, this is really the more important comparison. This means that it would take about 23,000 quakes of magnitude 5.8 to equal the energy released by one magnitude 8.7 event.</em></p>

A deep quake (<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisqually_earthquake">Nisqually</a> was 6.8 on the <a title="The 1930s-era Richter magnitude scale was replaced in 1970's with this new scale." target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale">moment magnitude scale</a> but 32 miles deep) has a much less serious impact than a shallow quake – as was modeled by the recent <a target="_blank" href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2010/3023/">Tacoma Fault scenario</a> (7.1 at 9 miles deep). Shallow quakes are much more likely to have damaging aftershocks too boot. Local soils can further alter conditions felt on the surface, as the caption of the Tacoma Fault map indicates.</p>
<p>Probably even more useful is the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_ground_acceleration">peak acceleration</a> – which is used by the USGS for their <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/</a>. Their <a target="_blank" href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2008/1128/">documentation</a> for this goes into hopeless detail on how best to measure the impact of quakes across the US.</p>

That’s a whole other convoluted topic, but the simple answer is to go to <a title="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/apps/" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/apps/">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/apps/</a> and map it yourself. Most anyway you look at this though: Vashon needs to be ready for a big one!</p>
