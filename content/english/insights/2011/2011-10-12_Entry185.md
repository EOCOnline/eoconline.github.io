As described by <a href="/Blogs/VashonPreparedness/tabid/164/EntryId/179/King-County-Executive-Dow-Constantine-rsquo-s-2011-Award-for-Community-Preparedness-to-VashonBePrepared.aspx" target="_blank">the actual 2011 King County Executive Award for Community Preparedness</a>, and by <a href="/Blogs/VashonPreparedness/tabid/164/EntryId/178/VashonBePrepared-and-Carnation-Duvall-Citizen-Corps-Council-recognized-for-preparedness-and-response-efforts.aspx" target="_blank">the official King County press release</a>, the award was to the entire community and emphasized the many contributors to Vashon&rsquo;s preparedness. The Carnation-Duvall Citizen Corps Council was likewise lauded with a similar award.</p>
<p>Formally accepting the 2011 King County Executive Award for Community Preparedness from Dow Constantine and Joe McDermott were VashonBePrepared President John Cornelison and VIFR Fire Chief Hank Lipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vashon residents and business share an ethic of preparedness, but it is wonderful that everyone&rsquo;s hard efforts can be recognized. Hopefully this can inspire others &ndash; on and off our island &ndash; to also prepare for the inevitable storms and earthquakes ahead,&rdquo; according to John Cornelison.</p>
<p>Constantine and State Senator (elect) Sharon Nelson had <a href="http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/vashon/vib/news/110523599.html" target="_blank">come over to Vashon</a> last fall at the height of the &ldquo;Gizzard Blizzard&rdquo; and were impressed with what they saw &ndash; a team of volunteers working alongside professionals. Dow Constantine &amp; Joe McDermott noted this, but also the ongoing work over the years by all of Vashon&rsquo;s residents and the numerous organizations striving for preparedness &ndash; working closely with Washington State and King County, especially through King County&rsquo;s Office Of Emergency Management.</p>

<p>VashonBePrepared is a coalition of disaster preparedness organizations on Vashon-Maury Island in Washington's Puget Sound region. </p>
<p>Under the umbrella of VashonBePrepared and operating under the auspices of Vashon Island Fire and Rescue and King County&rsquo;s Office of Emergency Management, continued emphasis has been placed on individual and community preparedness:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A functioning Emergency Operations Center (EOC) has been established, </li>
    <li>The Vashon Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) organization trained in excess of 200 islanders in minor firefighting, first aid, search and rescue and communication; </li>
    <li>Vashon Radio Club (an ARES affiliate) organized a parallel emergency communications network; </li>
    <li>The Medical Reserve Corps set up an emergency response structure to augment existing medical personnel and facilities; </li>
    <li>Over 100 informal Neighborhood Emergency Response Organizations (NERO's) have been activated and businesses are now organizing; </li>
    <li>Voice of Vashon (VoV) established an island wide emergency public information radio network; </li>
    <li>The Vashon Emergency Preparedness Committee (VEPC) continues the process of expanding plans for shelter and feeding of personnel in the aftermath of a disaster. </li>
</ul>
<p>VashonBePrepared helps recruit, train and coordinate volunteers, works closely with Vashon Island Fire &amp; Rescue (VIFR) to mitigate effects of disasters, and educates the public and local businesses on how to best prepare for disruptive events. Over 3% of island residents have volunteered with VashonBePrepared at one time or another and an unusually high percentage of islanders have lain in supplies. Maintaining this level of preparedness is a key challenge. Winter storms regularly knock out power for days and &ndash; along with periodic ferry outages &ndash; help residents maintain their alertness. Vashon residents are also aware of earthquake potential from Seattle and Tacoma Faults that lie near and under our island.</p>

<p>According to Joe Ulatoski, </p>
<p>&ldquo;1) Create a family communications plan. Everyone should know who &ndash; outside the Puget Sound Region &ndash; they can call. </p>
<p>2) Communicate with your neighbors who will be your first source of help after an event.</p>
<p>3) Store food, water and other basic supplies&nbsp; - enough for 10 days! See <a href="http://www.VashonBePrepared.org">www.VashonBePrepared.org</a> for checklists and other advice."</p>
