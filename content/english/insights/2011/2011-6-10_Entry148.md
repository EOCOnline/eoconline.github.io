<p>Understanding the basis for the seismic regulations in the nation’s building codes and standards is important to understanding how we protect the public from earthquake risk. FEMA P-749 provides a non-technical and readily understandable explanation of the intent and requirements of the seismic design criteria found in the nation’s building codes and standards.</p>
<p>One of the goals of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) is to encourage design and construction practices that address the earthquake hazard and minimize the resulting risk to life and property. The publication of FEMA P-749, a companion guide to the 2009 edition of the <em>NEHRP Recommended Seismic Provisions for New Buildings and Other Structures</em>, FEMA P-750, reaffirms FEMA’s ongoing commitment to achieving this goal.</p>

FEMA’s publication of the <em>2009 NEHRP Recommended Seismic Provisions</em>, which serve as a national resource for design professionals and the standards and codes development community, is a major ongoing commitment to achieving this goal.</p>
<p>The seismic requirements in U.S. model building codes and standards are updated through the volunteer efforts of design professionals and construction industry representatives under a process sponsored by FEMA and administered by the Building Science Safety Council (BSSC). At regular intervals, the BSSC develops and FEMA publishes the <em>NEHRP Recommended Seismic Provisions for New Buildings and Other Structures</em>. The <em>NEHRP Recommended Seismic Provisions</em> and the building codes and standards based on its recommendations are technical documents used primarily by professionals. However, a non-technical explanation of these requirements is important to understanding how the nation’s building codes and standards work to protect the public from the risk presented by earthquakes and other hazards.</p>
