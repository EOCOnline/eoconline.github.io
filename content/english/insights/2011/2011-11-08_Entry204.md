Do it when you set your clock forward or backward an hour. American Public Health Association is leading (or at least championing) this effort, as noted in this article: <a href="http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2011/11/07/Twice-a-year-Check-emergency-stockpile/UPI-85881320643709">http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2011/11/07/Twice-a-year-Check-emergency-stockpile/UPI-85881320643709</a> The <a href="http://www.getreadyforflu.org/clocksstocks/index.htm" target="_blank">campaign web site</a> has a number of helpful suggestions and guidelines.</p>
