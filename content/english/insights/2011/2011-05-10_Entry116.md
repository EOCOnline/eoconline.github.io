<div class="wlWriterHeaderFooter" style="float:none; margin:0px; padding:4px 0px 4px 0px;"><iframe src="http://www.facebook.com/widgets/like.php?href=http://vashoneoc.org/Blogs/VashonPreparedness/tabid/164/EntryId/116/NetQuakes.aspx" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; width:130px; height:80px"></iframe></div><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" alt="seismograph" align="right" src="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/netquakes/images/NetQuakes.jpg" width="314" height="240" />   <p>The USGS is trying to achieve a denser and more uniform spacing of seismographs in select urban areas to provide better measurements of ground motion during earthquakes. These measurements improve our ability to make rapid post-earthquake assessments of expected damage and contribute to the continuing development of engineering standards for construction. </p>  <p>To accomplish this, we developed a new type of digital seismograph that communicates its data to the USGS via the internet. The seismographs connect to a local network via WiFi and use existing broadband connections to transmit data after an earthquake. The instruments are designed to be installed in private homes, businesses, public buildings and schools with an existing broadband connection to the internet.</p>  <p>“NetQuakes?” - The name was apparently chosen with a nod to NetFlix, as these low cost seismographs can be delivered and returned via mail in case they need replacement!</p>  <h4>Sign Up</h4>  <p>Over the next several years the USGS hopes to deploy many more of these seismographs in the Greater Seattle and several urban California areas. The USGS is collecting names and addresses of people who are willing to host one of these seismographs so that as they become available, they can place them in the most effective locations.</p>  <h5>Pacific NW</h5>  <p>If you live in the Pacific NW (especially in the Seattle area), you can <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/netquakes/signup/pacnw/">sign up</a> if the location of your home or business is eligible.</p>  <h5>Regional Status as of December, 2010</h5>  <p>Currently 42 instruments are installed in the greater Seattle area and about 20 more instruments in hand to be installed. Sites have been chosen for many of these but there is still a chance for a few new sites to be chosen. Because of recent funding problems the actual installation process has slowed down as <a href="http://www.pnsn.org">PNSN</a> staff must deal with other more pressing issues from time to time.</p>  <p>I just signed up and got a report that all instruments were currently spoken for, but that more might become available in the future.</p>  <p align="right">-- Excerpted from <a title="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/netquakes/" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/netquakes/;">http://earthquake.usgs.gov/monitoring/netquakes/;</a> </p>  <p align="right">NW Specific info at <a title="http://www.pnsn.org/OPS/netquakes.html" href="http://www.pnsn.org/OPS/netquakes.html;">http://www.pnsn.org/OPS/netquakes.html<font color="#000000" face="Tahoma">;</font></a> and</p>  <p align="right"><a href="http://kuow.org/">KUOW’s</a> May 10th Morning Edition report on the program.</p>
