<p>The purpose of the club is to:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Volunteer</strong> radio skills, equipment and experience to the Tukwila Office of Emergency Management to provide volunteer resources, that in turn will work with the Tukwila Fire and Police in a civilian capacity </li>
    <li><strong>Train </strong>those interested in becoming licensed radio operators and help them achieve their radio licensing goals </li>
    <li><strong>Build a sense of Community</strong> by hosting monthly club meetings to introduce club members to new technology, best practices, equipment discussions and anything else of interest to the radio operator community </li>
</ul>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.tukwilaradioclub.org/" target="_blank">Tukwila Radio Club&rsquo;s web site</a>, there already is an impressive use of amateur radios by the fire department:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Every firefighter</strong> in the city is a licensed radio operator with emergency management training </li>
    <li><strong>Every fire department vehicle</strong> is equipped with amateur radios </li>
    <li><strong>Every area of the city </strong>is covered by multiple digital repeaters owned and operated by the city Emergency Management Office </li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a resident or business owner/manager/employee in Tukwila and would like to get involved, they encourage you to go and hear their plans!&nbsp; The club&rsquo;s first meeting will be held November 9, 2011 at 7 PM at Tukwila Fire Station #51 located at 444 Andover Park East in Tukwila.&nbsp; Visit <a href="http://www.TukwilaRadioClub.org">http://www.TukwilaRadioClub.org</a> or email info(at)TukwilaRadioClub.org for more information.</p>
