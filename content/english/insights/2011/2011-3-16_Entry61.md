<p><a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/assets_c/2011/03/japan_google-287.shtml"><img alt="japan_google.png" align="right" width="300" height="107" style="display: inline; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px" src="http://www.renesys.com/blog/assets_c/2011/03/japan_google-thumb-300x107-287.png" /></a>Today's <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2011/usc0001xgp/">8.9 magnitude earthquake in Japan</a> has had surprisingly limited impacts on the structure and routing dynamics of the regional Internet. Of roughly 6,000 Japanese network prefixes in the global routing table, only about 100 were temporarily withdrawn from service — and that number has actually <em>decreased</em> in the hours since the event. Other carriers around the region have reported congestion and drops in traffic due to follow-on effects of the quake, but most websites are up and operational, and the Internet is available to support critical communications.</p>
<p>Those who have been following our <a href="http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/03/what-libya-learned-from-egypt.shtml">blogs on Libya</a> will be familiar with the excellent <a href="http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/traffic/?r=JP&amp;l=WEBSEARCH&amp;csd=1299286146618&amp;ced=1299890946618">Google Transparency Report</a>, which summarizes the rate of queries coming from each country over time. Despite terrible fires, floods, and power outages, traffic from Japanese clients just keeps going. It's quite a remarkable plot.</p>
