Future funding is going to be tighter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><font face="Arial">The State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSP), which supports a variety of state and local endeavors, including exercises, training, planning and equipment was cut by $225 million. That’s slightly more than 26 percent of the program, leaving a 2011 budget of $725 million. FEMA asked for $1 billion for the SHSP program. <br />
The program receiving the second largest jolt was the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) program. It was cut by 18 percent or $162 million, also leaving $725 million. The UASI program covers the 64 largest municipalities in the U.S.</font></em></p>
