<p><u>Your help is urgently needed</u> to stem the flow of unneeded goods and volunteers into Joplin.&#160; You are encouraged to reach out to your employees, customers and other constituents on how those wanting to help can do so in a way that doesn't cause further impact, but rather aids in the response and recovery effort.</p>
<p>The following guidelines were developed by a coalition of government, voluntary agency and faith-based partners:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cash to a recognized voluntary agency is the single best way to help disaster survivors.&#160; Cash doesn't need to be sorted, stored or distributed, and it allows the voluntary agency to&#160; the donation towards the needs that most urgently need addressing.</li>
