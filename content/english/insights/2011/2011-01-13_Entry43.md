<p>The declaration (noted at <a title="http://www.seattlepi.com/local/433304_emergency12.html" href="http://www.seattlepi.com/local/433304_emergency12.html">www.seattlepi.com/local/433304_emergency12.html</a>) would presumably make affected homeowners and businesses eligible for low cost loans and other assistance.</p>
<p>Does anyone on Vashon know this process and how to best support locals seeking such assistance for this or any future disaster? If so, please contact me as Iâ€™m curious about this process.</p>
