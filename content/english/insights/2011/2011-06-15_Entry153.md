My neighbor who had a very expensive landslide late last year just pointed this useful information out to me.

It was declared unsafe and the owners moved out. </p>  <p>Knowing whether you are in a slide-prone area is the first step in preparing for and preventing landslides.

Your county or city geologist or planning department may have specific information on areas vulnerable to land sliding.</p>  <p>• Seek advice of geotechnical experts for evaluating landslide hazards or designing corrective techniques to reduce landslide risk.</p>  <p>• Plant ground cover on slopes to stabilize the land, and build retaining walls.</p>  <p>• Plan at least two evacuation routes since roads may become blocked or closed.</p>  <p>• Make arrangements for housing in the event you need to evacuate your home.</p>  <p>• Plan for &quot;earthquakes&quot; and &quot;severe storms&quot; that can cause a landslide.</p>  <p><strong>Landslide warning signs</strong></p>  <p>• Doors or windows stick or jam for the first time.</p>  <p>• New cracks appear in plaster, tile, brick or foundation.</p>  <p>• Outside walls, walks or stairs begin pulling away from the building.</p>  <p>• Slowly developing, widening cracks appear on the ground or on paved areas such as streets or driveways.</p>  <p>• Underground utility lines break.</p>  <p>• Bulging ground appears at the base of a slope.</p>  <p>• Water breaks through the ground surface in new locations.</p>  <p>• Fences, retaining walls, utility poles or trees tilt or move.</p>  <p>• You hear a faint rumbling sound that increases in volume as the landslide nears. The ground slopes downward in one specific direction and may begin shifting that direction under your feet.</p>  <p>• Sinkholes. A sinkhole occurs when groundwater dissolves a vulnerable land surface, such as limestone, causing the land surface to collapse from a lack of support.</p>
