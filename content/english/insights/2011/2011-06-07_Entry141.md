This is an innovative step that is not commonly done elsewhere but makes great sense given’s Vashon’s potential isolation and proximity to several faults.</p>  <p>Today we received notification that Camp Burton has actually received King County’s completed purchase order. No funds have exchanged hands – but simply having this purchase order available and pre-completed means that a potentially lengthy delay in getting crews to Vashon and working will no longer be necessary. Our congratulations and appreciation are due to the King County for taking the initiative to make this happen, and especially through the work of Hillman Mitchell (Director) and Don Price (Emergency Management Program Manager), both with the King County Office of Emergency Management.</p>
