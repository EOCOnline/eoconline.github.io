<h3>About This Conference</h3>
<p>This day and a half conference is hosted by enableUS and the Community Emergency Preparedness Information Network (CEPIN) and will examine some of the greatest challenges that emergency management, disability, public health and human services communities face when responding to disasters and emergencies.&#160; This interactive and engaging seminar will focus on new FEMA sheltering guidelines, emergency evacuations for disability communities, jurisdictional liability issues and building collaborative community partnerships.&#160; Regional issues such as ice storms, flooding and earthquakes will be discussed as well as the effectiveness of special needs registries, information sharing networks and accessible communications.&#160;&#160; Speakers from national, state and local government agencies and organizations will focus on programs that have worked in their communities as well as continued shortfalls and challenges that they experience.&#160; Attendees will have an opportunity to network with speakers, sponsors and most importantly counterparts from throughout the Pacific Northwest to discuss approaches that they are taking to tackle these important issues in their own communities.&#160;</p>
<p>It should be noted that ALL accessibility needs will be met at this conference.&#160; ASL, CART, large-print materials, service animal, wheelchair and power chair accommodations will be provided to foster an environment where all attendees have the opportunity to interact, participate and learn.</p>
