According to the national <a href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.html" target="_blank">Climate Prediction Center’s announcement</a> yesterday, it looks like a wetter, but not necessarily colder winter than average. Their analysis balances a variety of models, each with a differing assessment, complicating the prediction. My personal advice: expect rain and look out the window for the latest weather update.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-06/la-nina-forecast-to-strengthen-into-2012-climate-center-says.html" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> has some additional background on La Nina.</p>
