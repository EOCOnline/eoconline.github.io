It sounds like he wants to involve the community, and actually go beyond the lowest level first responders – and even beyond “able-bodied adults who have the financial means to meet basic needs“ – and instead focus on those the disasters typically impacts most: those less fortunate, pets and others they’ve had to previously specially address with annexes to the main plans. The new plans are supposedly much more oriented to those least resilient.</p>  <p>Reading between the lines, it also sounds like he’s going to use social media and direct community information to be more responsive – when it really counts. After Tom Miner’s indication that <a href="/Blogs/JohnsVashonDisasterPreparednessBlog/tabid/164/EntryId/96/Tom-Miner-presents-blunt-message-to-sell-out-crowd-for-VashonBePrepared-2011-Annual-Meeting.aspx" target="_blank">federal help can take 10-14 days to arrive</a>, this would be a huge objective.</p>  <p>Some excerpts:</p>  <blockquote>   <p><em>In a major shift at FEMA, Fugate is looking beyond the information provided by professional first responders during an emergency, instead creating a two-way dialogue with the public, media and private sector to help provide quicker disaster assessments. </em></p>    <p><em>[…]</em></p>    <p>Fugate said he’s learned during his years of battling floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and wildfires at the local, state and now federal level that any agency’s response is slowed mainly by a lack of information. </p>    <p>“I’ve learned that by the time I have all the facts to make the perfect decision, I was too late to respond,” he said.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Attention to one of the largest costs of disasters – debris removal – is another new initiative. There’s more too, it is a good read!
