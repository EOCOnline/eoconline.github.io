The NDRF defines how we will work together as a nation to best meet the disaster recovery needs of individuals, families, communities, and states.&#160; <br />The NDRF is based on the principle that all emergency management partners, including the private sector, non-profit organizations, faith-based organizations, and individual citizens, as well as local, state, tribal and federal government agencies, have a role to play in the recovery process.&#160; In catastrophic scenarios, leveraging Whole Community resources to meet the needs of disaster impacted communities is essential.&#160; If you have a role in disaster recovery operations, you don’t want to miss this!     <br />To join this <strong>free</strong> webinar on <strong>Tuesday November 8th at 10:50 a.m.</strong> PST, <a href="http://www.citizencorps.gov/news/webcasts/ndrf.shtm" target="_blank">click here</a>. We ask that you register fifteen minutes prior to the start time. </p>
