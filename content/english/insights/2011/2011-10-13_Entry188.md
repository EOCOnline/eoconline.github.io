<p>A number of discussions later, the Chamber held an initial meeting to look at disaster&rsquo;s impact on business on September 15th with Fire Chief Hank Lipe, VIFR Fire Commissioner Chairman Rex Stratton, and VashonBePrepared&rsquo;s Joe Ulatoski and Rick Wallace presenting.</p>
<p>Interest from the business community was excellent. Learning that nationally 40% of businesses do not survive a disaster provided a sober incentive for our local business owners to undertake cost-effective steps to ensure their businesses continuity after storms, earthquakes, or any other disaster.</p>

According to Debi Richards, only businesses from select neighborhoods were present today &ndash; with additional meetings to be held for businesses from other areas of the island. Interested businesses should contact Debi Richards&nbsp;at the Vashon Chamber of Commerce to ensure they are included in future communications about the Business NERO program.</p>

Interest in the <a href="/Blogs/VashonPreparedness/tabid/164/EntryId/187/VashonBePrepared-101-Saturday-October-22.aspx" target="_blank">Vashon 101</a> course, free CPR and first aid courses from <a href="http://www.vifr.org/" target="_blank">VIFR</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://vashonwacert.samariteam.com/" target="_blank">CERT</a> class (Spring 2012) were all very high.</p>
<p>Many excellent resources for businesses interested in preparedness exist on the web, including the following:</p>

</ul>
<p>Formation of Vashon&rsquo;s Business NERO (Business Neighborhood Emergency Response Organization)&nbsp;program has been one of the most exciting developments this year, and VashonBePrepared is delighted to have the Chamber&rsquo;s vitality directed at this critical function.</p>
