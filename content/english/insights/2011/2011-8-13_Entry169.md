<p><a href="/images/dnnBlog/1/169/Windows-Live-Writer-346f49406c17_B537-Hazus2011Conference%2cSeattle_2.gif"><img style="width: 474px; float: right; height: 167px;" alt="2011 Hazus Conference, Seattle, WA" src="/images/dnnBlog/1/Hazus2011Conference,Seattle.gif" /></a>The Associated Press came to this week&rsquo;s 5th Annual Hazus conference held at the federal building and wrote up a nice piece citing (yet again) that we are not ready for the huge quakes possible from any number of faults, but especially the Seattle and Cascadia faults:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of particular worry to government agencies - and emergency planners like Schelling - is the 680-mile long Cascadia fault line, which runs just 50 miles off Washington's shore. Scientists have found that a big 8.0 to 9.0 earthquake has hit that fault line about every 500 years. The last one struck in 1700. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; According to a 2005 study that used Hazus data, such a strong earthquake would level parts of the region, bringing landslides, tsunamis, fires, and spilling hazardous materials among other disastrous effects. This year, FEMA will partner with the Canadian government to do a bi-national model of a 9.0 earthquake hitting the Pacific Northwest, creating an updated examination of the 2005 study.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also intend to write up more details about the conference (which I attended) in the coming days.</p>
