The rupture extended about 200 miles along the Japan coast, resulting in approximately 100 feet of vertical slip and causing a series of devastating tsunamis. A similar event along the Cascadia Subduction Zone could extend from Vancouver Island to Northern California, affecting western Washington and Oregon communities.</p>
<p>The ground motion records indicate very strong ground shaking (&gt;1.0g) with long duration (&gt;3.0 minutes). The M9.0 earthquake and five aftershocks greater than M7.0 affected coastal areas as well as the Tokyo metropolitan area. The earthquake and tsunami resulted in approximately 15,000 fatalities, left approximately 12,000 missing, displaced 160,000, and caused an estimated $200-$300 billion in losses.</p>
<p>Recognizing the impacts this earthquake may have on the Pacific Northwest, the Structural Engineers Association of Washington (SEAW) formed a reconnaissance team of engineers to observe and evaluate damage in the affected areas. The team traveled the metropolitan cities of Tokyo and Sendai, and along the Tohoku coast to observe the impacted areas. The team also met with Japanese earthquake research organizations, design/construction professionals, and public officials to learn more about the extent of the damage and standard design practices in Japan.</p>
<p>The team will present their findings at this seminar intended for anyone interested in first-hand accounts of the earthquake’s devastation and lessons learned for improving seismic safety in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>The Structural Engineers Association of Washington (SEAW) is a not-for-profit professional organization of leading structural engineers dedicated to the advancement of excellence in structural engineering through building code advocacy, continuing education, research, emergency preparedness, exchange of ideas, and mentoring. Over the past sixty years, SEAW has pursued issues affecting public safety and professional practice in structural engineering and SEAW members actively participate in the development of building and material codes and standards at both local and national levels.</p>
<p>SEAW has organized earthquake reconnaissance teams in past earthquakes that have included the 1995 Kobe Earthquake, 1999 Taiwan Earthquake, 2001 Nisqually Earthquake, 2008 Wenchuan (China) Earthquake, 2010 Haiti Earthquake, and the 2010 Chile Earthquake. These efforts are to bring back lessons learned for our region's architects, engineers, and public officials to improve the seismic safety and awareness of our region. SEAW was also the principal author of the state-of-the-art study entitled "Scenario for a Magnitude 6.7 Earthquake on the Seattle Fault" published by the State of Washington Emergency Management Division and the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute in 2005.</p>
