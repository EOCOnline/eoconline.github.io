The comment period for the new <em>National Incident Management System Training Plan</em> ended February 22, several hundred comments have been adjudicated, and just last week the document was transmitted up to FEMA <a href="http://www.fema.gov/about/bios/tmanning.shtm" target="_blank">Deputy Administrator Manning</a>, according to the Emergency Management Institute. Final release is likely just weeks away - without new obstacles. Access the The <em>NIMS Training Plan (Draft)</em> at <a href="http://www.regulations.gov/#!docketDetail;dct=FR+PR+N+O+SR;rpp=10;po=0;D=FEMA-2009-0012" target="_blank">www.regulations.gov</a>, Docket #<strong> <a href="http://links.govdelivery.com/track?type=click&amp;enid=bWFpbGluZ2lkPTExODM1MTUmbWVzc2FnZWlkPVBSRC1CVUwtMTE4MzUxNSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTEyNzY3Mzc4OTEmZW1haWxpZD1taWtld2FyZDU0QGVhcnRobGluay5uZXQmdXNlcmlkPW1pa2V3YXJkNTRAZWFydGhsaW5rLm5ldCZmbD0mZXh0cmE9TXVsdGl2YXJpYXRlSWQ9JiYm&amp;&amp;&amp;102&amp;&amp;&amp;http://www.regulations.gov/#%21documentDetail;D=FEMA-2009-0012-0002">FEMA-2009-0012</a>.</strong></p>  <p>The document has received a fundamental rewrite and is actually ~10% shorter, with a bit less background. For instance the figure at bottom-left (<em>Operational Foundation for NIMS Training and Personnel Qualification Guidelines</em>, from the <em>Five-Year NIMS Training Plan</em>) has been dropped.</p>  <p>Why is this important for Vashon preparedness efforts? Because this outlines what <a href="http://www.fema.gov/emergency/nims/" target="_blank">NIMS</a>&#160;<a href="http://www.fema.gov/emergency/nims/NIMSTrainingCourses.shtm" target="_blank">training</a> each of us should have in our roles as Single Resource Leader, Unit Leader, Branch Director, Section Chief or Incident Commander.</p>  <p>Many Vashon volunteers attended ICS-100a and ICS-700 courses taught at VIFR’s Penny Farcy building back about January 2009. A few of us are also looking at attending <a href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/safety/prepare/EmergencyManagementProfessionals/TrainingandExercise.aspx" target="_blank">ICS-300 and ICS-400</a> training this year.</p>  <p>Everyone should look at the chart to the right and decide what courses apply to your position/role. We currently recommend that everyone active in the EOC or other leadership positions at least take the free, online courses at <a href="http://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/is100b.asp" target="_blank">IS-100.b - Introduction to Incident Command System, ICS-100</a> and <a href="http://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/is700a.asp" target="_blank">IS-700.a NIMS An Introduction</a>. These courses will provide a common understanding of concepts and terminology that can streamline communications wit each other, with professionals in the field and - in a major (class II or I) incident, with outside agencies.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href="./images/99/WLW-FEMAUpdatesNIMSTraining_7CF3-image_4.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 5px 5px 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="Five-Year NIMS Training Plan - Figure 1: Operational Foundation for NIMS Training and Personnel Qualification Guidelines" border="0" alt="Five-Year NIMS Training Plan - Figure 1: Operational Foundation for NIMS Training and Personnel Qualification Guidelines" align="left" src="./images/99/WLW-FEMAUpdatesNIMSTraining_7CF3-image_thumb_1.png" width="260" height="390" /></a>In addition, this document outlines the training required for credentialing:&#160; <em>“In addition to delineating responsibilities and actions, the NIMS Training Plan defines the process for developing training and personnel qualification requirements for emergency management/response personnel.”</em> (Federal Register / Vol. 76, No. 13 / Thursday, January 20, 2011, page 3648)</p>
