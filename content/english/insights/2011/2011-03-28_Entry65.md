By filtering for keywords and locating these reports on a map, a wide variety of emergency managers, researchers, and citizens can rapidly get a better feeling for late breaking information – well before a reporter or others have had time to synthesize the data into a summary or overview.</p>
<p>Kathleen Farrell just pointed out this excellent article, <em><a target="_blank" href="http://chronicle.com/article/Academics-Join-Relief-Efforts/126912/?sid=at&amp;utm_source=at&amp;utm_medium=en">Academics Join Relief Efforts Around the World as Crisis Mappers</a></em>, from the Chronicle of Higher Education that provides a good overview of this info – points out some of the open source software (from <a title="http://www.ushahidi.com/" href="http://Ushahidi">Ushahidi</a>) that is being used behind the scenes to make this happen.</p>
<p>It would be fun to see if we could add some of this functionality to our own web site – so we could rapidly set up a situational information page – at least for internal if not also external use after an event. Something like this would allow business owners to report in with their status via a variety of means. Currently we’re exploring use of <a target="_blank" href="http://vashoneoc.org/Reference/Mapping/CriticalLocations.aspx">Google Maps for managing our critical locations</a>, but this would take things another level deeper!</p>
<p>King County is also looking at a regional situational awareness upgrade, to advance beyond what <a target="_blank" href="http://www.esi911.com/esi/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=30">WebEOC</a> can provide, so ideally all these systems can play well together.</p>
