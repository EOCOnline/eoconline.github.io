<p>The King County Mass Care Workgroup is hosting the <b>annual Mass Care Regional Forum on June 8 </b>and you are invited! The goal of this free forum is to bring together government, non-profit, faith-based and other partners who would have a role in Mass Care (shelter, feeding, distribution of emergency supplies, etc.) for disasters in King County. Information will be provided and exchanged on planning efforts, emerging issues, resources, and channels for receiving and offering assistance during a disaster.</p>
<p>This year’s Forum features keynote speaker Joy Portella from Mercy Corps sharing her experience in going to Japan after the earthquake and tsunami. Presentations will include an overview of the development of a King County Disaster Behavioral Health Plan, how to apply the new Guidance on Functional Needs Support Services (FNSS) in shelters, and emerging issues and current activities in King County Emergency Management. Additionally, questions, concerns and ideas submitted by attendees will be addressed in an interactive session.</p>
<p>There will also be an optional Mass Care 101 session from 8:00 – 9:00.</p>
<p><b>To sign up for the event, please go to</b> <b><a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/masscare2011">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/masscare2011</a></b></p>
