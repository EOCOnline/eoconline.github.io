<blockquote>
<p>In response to direction by Congress to develop "all-hazard regional catastrophic event plans and preparedness," in 2008 FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security established the Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grant Program (RCPGP), and released grants to the ten largest urban areas in the country. To implement this Program, grant funded staff are working with partners in the region to develop plans and processes to support catastrophic disaster planning, and are housed at the Seattle Office of Emergency Management.</p>
<p>The Puget Sound RCPGP will enhance regional catastrophic preparedness through planning for catastrophic events associated with earthquake, bioterrorism, and severe winter storms and flooding. As a region, planners will work to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Fix shortcomings in existing plans;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Build regional planning processes and planning communities;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Link operational and capabilities-based planning to resource allocation.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
