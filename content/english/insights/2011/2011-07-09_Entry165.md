<p><img width="159" height="223" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right;" alt="Hazard Mitigation Grant Programs" src="http://www.bhs.idaho.gov/images/Mitigation/HMA-Logo.jpg" />FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Assistance (HMA) grant programs provide funding for eligible mitigation activities that reduce disaster losses and protect life and property from future disaster damages. Currently, FEMA administers the following HMA grant programs:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.fema.gov/government/grant/hmgp/index.shtm">Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP)</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.fema.gov/government/grant/pdm/index.shtm">Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM)</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.fema.gov/government/grant/fma/index.shtm">Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA)</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.fema.gov/government/grant/rfc/index.shtm">Repetitive Flood Claims (RFC)</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><a href="http://www.fema.gov/government/grant/srl/index.shtm">Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL)</a></p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>FEMA's HMA grants are provided to eligible Applicants (e.g., Washington State) that, in turn, provide subgrants to local governments (King County) &ndash; who then disperses it to communities such as Vashon. The Applicant selects and prioritizes subapplications developed and submitted to them by subapplicants. These subapplications are submitted to FEMA for consideration of funding.</p>
<p>Translation: we need to submit our requests ASAP to King County OEM, so that they can prepare their grant requests to Washington State, who then will request funds for the entire package, and reapportion whatever they actually receive based on their procedures.</p>
