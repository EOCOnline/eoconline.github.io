<p>Everyone interested in King County Mass Care issues should plan on attending an all morning forum to be held June 8th at the King County Emergency Coordination Center (ECC) in Renton. Organizers include Jill Watson (Seattle), Dave Nichols (PHSKC), Sarah Miller (Auburn), Mike Ryan (Zone 1), Howard Ferrucci (American Red Cross), Rachel Myers (Renton) and Jan Beck (Bellevue). </p>  <p>The day will begin at 8 AM with an introduction to Mass Care. Resources will be available throughout the morning and a number of exciting information sharing opportunities are also under consideration in addition to a list of great speakers. Details should be published here at <a href="http://www.VashonEOC.com">www.VashonEOC.com</a>, but you can also contact Cathy Rogers as the day gets closer. Hopefully we can car pool together to this.</p>
