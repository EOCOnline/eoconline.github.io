For us in Washington—the second highest earthquake risk state in the country—putting good research to use is of the utmost importance. I asked EMD’s Earthquake Program Manager John Schelling say more about this great program, below.     <br /><strong>—Jim Mullen, director, Washington State Emergency Management</strong></p>  <p>It’s not hard to see that our homes, our offices, our schools, and our overall communities are safer and more resistant to earthquake damage, thanks to NEHRP-sponsored research. Here are recent examples of Washington EMD initiative have been enhanced by NEHRP’s umbrella assistance:   <br />• Washington EMD has partnered with the federal and state agencies to develop 20 earthquake scenarios that will examine community vulnerability to faults throughout the state. This work will be incorporated into state and local mitigation and response plans, help drive exercises, and facilitate a better response when an earthquake occurs.     <br />• The Washington State Seismic Safety Committee is developing policy recommendations through a project entitled “The Resilient Washington State Initiative.” The RWS project examines our current capacity for resilience to damaging earthquakes and seeks to identify what gaps may exist. The Committee hopes this effort will provide a lasting foundation for future seismic policy to concretely address identified shortfalls in Washington State.     <br />• Demonstrating the true value of public-private partnerships, the Structural Engineering Association of Washington is assisting with a pilot project to systematically evaluate and establish the seismic risk for all public school buildings in the cities of Aberdeen and Walla Walla. The pilot will develop a methodology for prioritizing schools across the state that need seismic retrofitting and permit a strategic, targeted approach for providing a safe learning environment for Washington state’s most precious assets, our kids. Carrying out the project is a volunteer team led by Degenkolb Engineers CEO, Mr. Stacy Bartoletti, along with staff from the Washington Department of Natural Resources, Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction and EMD.</p>  <p>NEHRP is “up for renewal.” On May 5, the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee approved an amended version of Senate Bill 646, which would reauthorize the NEHRP. It’s likely the House will soon begin to address this important piece of legislation through H.R. 1379.</p>  <p>I hope you will take a moment to let our congressional delegation know about the value of NEHRP to Washington state. I am genuinely hopeful that the reauthorization of NEHRP will be accomplished and our nation, state and local communities will continue to be better prepared and able to bounce forward when the time comes.</p>  <p>- <strong>John Schelling, Earthquake Program Manager, Washington State Emergency Management</strong></p>  <p align="right">-- Both of these are excerpted from <a title="http://blogemd.blogspot.com/2011/06/making-research-real-scientists-and.html" href="http://blogemd.blogspot.com/2011/06/making-research-real-scientists-and.html">http://blogemd.blogspot.com/2011/06/making-research-real-scientists-and.html</a></p>  <p>List of Federal and State Politicians for Vashon:</p>  <p><a href="http://hq-salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/5950/getLocal.jsp?zip=98070">http://hq-salsa.wiredforchange.com/o/5950/getLocal.jsp?zip=98070</a></p>  <p>Some Earthquake probability data for Vashon:</p>  <p><a href="http://www.homefacts.com/earthquakes/Washington/King-County/Vashon.html">www.homefacts.com/earthquakes/Washington/King-County/Vashon.html</a></p>
