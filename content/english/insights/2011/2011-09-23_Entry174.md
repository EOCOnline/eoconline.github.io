This report focuses on public health laboratories, which are critical for identifying and understanding health threats and disease outbreaks, and response readiness planning, which enables communities to efficiently distribute medicines and other supplies received from CDC’s Strategic National Stockpile during a public health emergency. The report compares recent data to past data indicating national improvements in these two preparedness capabilities. </p>  <p align="right">- <a href="http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/news/2011/09/cdc-report-highlights-progress-in-nations-public-health-preparedness.aspx"><b>http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/news/2011/09/cdc-report-highlights-progress-in-nations-public-health-preparedness.aspx</b></a><b> </b></p>  <p align="left">The CDC’s description of this report can be found at: <a title="http://www.cdc.gov/phpr/pubs-links/2011/" href="http://www.cdc.gov/phpr/pubs-links/2011/">http://www.cdc.gov/phpr/pubs-links/2011/</a>&#160;</p>  <p>For CDC’s guidance on “Coping With a Disaster or Traumatic Event”, see <a title="http://emergency.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/" href="http://emergency.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/">http://emergency.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/</a></p>
