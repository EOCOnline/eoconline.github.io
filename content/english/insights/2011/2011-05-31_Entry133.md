For the 2-degree goal to remain attainable, emissions in 2020 can't be greater than 32 gigatonnes.</p>  <p align="right">-- <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/05/31/world.carbon.emissions/index.html?hpt=T2"><b>www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/05/31/world.carbon.emissions/index.html?hpt=T2</b></a><b> </b></p>  <p align="left"><b>Germany to shutter reactors 2022</b></p>  <p>Europe's economic powerhouse, Germany, announced plans Monday to abandon nuclear energy over the next 11 years, outlining an ambitious strategy in the wake of Japan's Fukushima disaster to replace atomic power with renewable energy sources.</p>  <p>Chancellor Angela Merkel said she hopes the transformation to more solar, wind and hydroelectric power serves as a roadmap for other countries.</p>  <p>Merkel's government said it will shut down all 17 nuclear power plants in Germany — the world's fourth-largest economy and Europe's biggest — by 2022. The government had no immediate estimate of the transition's overall cost.</p>  <p align="right">- <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/05/30/501364/main20067387.shtml?tag=cbsnewsSectionContent.11"><b>www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/05/30/501364/main20067387.shtml?tag=cbsnewsSectionContent.11</b></a></p>
