The Conference has grown into the largest emergency management conference in the Pacific Northwest, bringing together non-profit organizations, public agencies, business and industry, military, healthcare, and schools to explore emergency management issues, principles, and practices.    <br />The Conference is soliciting presentations regarding the on-going partnerships necessary to support successful emergency preparedness activities in all areas. </p>  <p>Presentations that focus on lessons learned, best practices, participant interaction, and fostering partnerships in emergency management are strongly encouraged. Topics of interest include:&#160;&#160; </p>  <ul>   <li>First-hand accounts of lessons learned </li>    <li>Disaster resilience/sustainability </li>    <li>Practical application of scholarly research </li>    <li>Case studies </li>    <li>Business disaster preparedness and contingency planning </li>    <li>Climate change and emergency management </li>    <li>Continuity of Operations (COOP) </li>    <li>New technological applications in emergency management </li>    <li>Information management practices at different phases of a disaster </li>    <li>Professional education and development </li>    <li>Healthcare contingency planning and preparedness </li>    <li>School preparedness </li> </ul>  <p>Presentation sessions are 75 minutes in length, though a limited number of double sessions may be available. </p>  <p>Our 2011 Conference drew over 600 attendees, including; 70 speakers, and more than 30 vendors over a two-day period. Conference attendees included emergency managers (local, state, and federal), state and local officials, business and industry representatives, the military reserve and National Guard, public utilities, and volunteer agencies. </p>  <p>All submissions must be made online. Please note that the Partners in Emergency Preparedness conference does not typically pay honorariums or travel expenses, though they are considered on a case-by-case basis. This helps us keep registration fees low to benefit the widest possible range of participants in the emergency management field. As a non-profit educational organization, our mission is to provide an affordable, high-quality conference in the Pacific Northwest. </p>  <p>Questions may be addressed to the Curriculum Committee Chair at: <a href="mailto:curriculum@piepc.org">curriculum@piepc.org</a> </p>  <p><strong></strong></p>  <p><a href="http://www.PIEPC.ORG">WWW.PIEPC.ORG</a><img border="0" src="http://confblast.wsu.edu/enewsletterpro/t.aspx?S=1&amp;ID=151&amp;NL=28&amp;N=180&amp;Imp=True&amp;SI=70190" /></p>
