<p>According to Jeff <span style="font-family: 'Calibri','sans-serif'; font-size: 11pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">Isaacson,</span> Volunteer Recruitment Coordinator for American Red Cross Serving King &amp; Kitsap Counties, people will be trained in both Mass Care and Disaster Action Team (DAT). So the classes will cover sheltering, disaster assessment, Safe and Well linking, and client casework (i.e. when the Red Cross responds to a fire).</p>
<p>Disaster Action Teams are&#160;"teams of trained Red Cross workers sent to the scene of a disaster to provide immediate disaster relief to those affected by disaster and to emergency workers responding to the incident. DAT workers often consist of both paid workers and volunteers."</p>
