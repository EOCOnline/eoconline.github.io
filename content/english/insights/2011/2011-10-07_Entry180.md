The system has been improved gradually overtime and no longer relies on monthly volunteers swapping out manually charged batteries for instance. The new system is actually located inside the fire station and so has a trickle charger that will keep the batteries topped off.</p>  <p><a href="./images/180/Upgrades-to-North-End-TIS-Alert-Sign_E2D2-ff_1276750_2.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; margin: 5px 5px 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="" border="0" alt="" align="left" src="./images/180/Upgrades-to-North-End-TIS-Alert-Sign_E2D2-ff_1276750_thumb.jpg" width="342" height="240" /></a>When volunteers at <a href="http://www.voiceofvashon.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=52&amp;Itemid=20" target="_blank">Voice of Vashon Standing By</a> put a certain series of tones over the air, a tone activated relay (that Steve is pointing to in the photo to the left) identifies this signal from the battery powered AM radio, and turns on the flashing light at the top of the outdoor sign for 15 minutes. Voice of Vashon will broadcast these tones periodically to keep the sign in an alerted status.</p>  <p>Thanks to VIFRâ€™s Bob Larsen, Steve Allen, Daniel Luechtefeld, Jeff Hoyt, Mike Masi, Mark Bennion, Rick Wallace and the entire Voice of Vashon Standing By team for designing, installing and maintaining this innovative and critical system. Remember to tune to 1650 AM for the latest updates!</p>
