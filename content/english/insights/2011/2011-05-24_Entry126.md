While he thinks most people will like the hotter summers also forecast - I’m not so sure I like that!</p>  <p>Sadly, if you hadn’t heard <a href="http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2011/05/no-more-weather-on-kuow-weekday.html" target="_blank">KUOW has ‘fired’ Cliff Mass</a> over editorializing on the Weekday Show. His shows have been insightful – and even brilliant. I’m surprised KUOW thinks their audience can’t handle an occasional opinion.</p>
