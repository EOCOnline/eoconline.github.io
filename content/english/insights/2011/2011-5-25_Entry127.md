In FY 2011, DHS grants were reduced by $780 million from the FY 2010 enacted level, nearly a quarter of FY 2010 DHS grant funding.&#160; <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/ynews/releases/pr_1305812474325.shtm">Read the full announcement here</a>.</p>
<p>FY 11 Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) guidance for State Homeland Security Program (SHSP) and Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) promotes the priority of Advancing “Whole Community” Security and Emergency Management. The Citizen Corps Program (CCP), one of five HSGP programs, mission remains to bring whole community and government leaders together to coordinate the involvement of community members and organizations in emergency preparedness, planning, mitigation, response and recovery.&#160; Citizen Corps Councils around the country will receive nearly $10 million in FY 11 to support this mission.&#160; Go to <a href="http://www.citizencorps.gov/">www.citizencorps.gov</a> to learn more about Citizen Corps.</p>
