(We’ll actually be over achievers by holding a two day event, on June 24 &amp; 25!)</p>
<p>Events kick off Saturday with breakfast at Sporty's (an hour early at 8:00 AM) with a procession to the venue on Sunrise Ridge where we’ll be busy positioning the club’s emergency communications trailer, a slew of radios, antennas, email stations operating over radio, and a table o’ treats. Official operations commence at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Club President Sharon Danielson, KE7HBZ/AE, Jim Tharp, WA7KYI and Georgia Galus will coordinate activities and volunteers handling set-up, take-down, logistics, sign-making, food (including Maxine's famous BBQ ribs!) and Elmer's showing novices how to broadcast over amateur radio.</p>
<p>A number of new amateur radio operators were just licensed yesterday. (A future class is already being organized according to a note on the club’s home page!) So there should be a great mix of experienced and novice hams – and the public is always very welcome to come to these events. Kids are especially encouraged to come and participate as many of our hams got their start at an early age while still in school.</p>
<p>Practice for emergency field set-up and operations on alternate forms of power, emergency communications, contacting distant states and countries, sending pictures, emails and other digital transmissions over the radio and electronics are a number of other topics sure to be demonstrated or discussed during field day. Some operations may go into the night and events will wind up Sunday Morning with take-down.</p>
