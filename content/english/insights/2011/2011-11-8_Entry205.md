<p>CBS recently listed a number of sobering facts about <em><strong>earthquake insurance</strong></em> that anyone from a scesmicly active area - like those of us from the Salish Sea would do well to be familiar with. Most know it isn&rsquo;t included in standard homeowner&rsquo;s policies, but even with it beware of the large number of restrictions in comparison to fire or other policies.</p>
<p>The topics covered are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Deductibles </li>
    <li>Personal possessions </li>
    <li>Exclusions </li>
    <li>Loss of use </li>
    <li>Uncovered losses don't count toward the deductible </li>
    <li>Cost of coverage </li>
    <li>Who suffers catastrophic claims </li>
    <li>Mitigating risks </li>
</ol>
