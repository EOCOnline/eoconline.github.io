Other fire safety organizations promote monthly drills – as a way to bolster reaction times during a real emergency.</p>  <p>This likely should also hold for other preparedness plans for Vashon families – and businesses.</p>  <p>A <a href="http://www.redcross.org/www-files/Documents/GovernmentRelations/09Oct01DeFrancisTestimony.pdf" target="_blank">Red Cross recent survey</a> shows that 80% of Americans had taken at least one key preparedness step, such as:    <br />• 47% assembled emergency kit    <br />• 45% chosen out of town contact    <br />• 24% practiced emergency plan    <br />But only 12% of Americans are reasonably prepared for a disaster, as recommended by the Red Cross.</p>
