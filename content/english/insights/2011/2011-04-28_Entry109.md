<p>In the coming weeks the <a target="_blank" href="http://vashonrotary.org/">Vashon Rotary Club</a> will be looking for a totally new community project to support â€“ up to a maximum of $3,500. But this local club amount will be matched by Rotary District 5030 for a total maximum of $7,000.&#160; Smaller projects are welcome too.</p>
<p>Criteria for previous projects included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Totally new project</li>
    <li>Publicity from project</li>
    <li>Participation with other Rotary Clubs</li>
    <li>Humanitarian aspects</li>
    <li>Additional funds contributed by recipient (might volunteer time qualify?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please coordinate your requests for these funds with Jan Milligan and myself. Projects receiving the support of the VashonBePrepared Board will automatically demonstrate broader community endorsement for the proposal.</p>
