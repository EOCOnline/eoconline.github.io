<p>Residents and business owners in unincorporated King County have a new way to report non-emergency crimes and traffic complaints.</p>
<p>The King County Sheriff's Office launched a new online reporting system today at www.reporttosheriff.org. Citizens living in unincorporated King County and the 12 communities that contract with the Sheriff's Office can use the website to report a variety of crimes, including vandalism, car prowls, thefts from vehicles or yards, identity theft, mail and bicycle thefts and nuisance phone calls. Abandoned vehicles, suspicious activity, drug activity and chronic traffic problems also can be reported.</p>
<p>Crime victims will be able to print out copies of the their reports so the information can be sent to insurance companies.</p>
<p>The system is meant for non-emergencies. Emergencies and in-progress crimes should still be reported to 911. <br />
"This new reporting system was developed for the convenience of folks who may not want to call in or wait for a deputy," Sheriff Sue Rahr said in a press release.</p>
