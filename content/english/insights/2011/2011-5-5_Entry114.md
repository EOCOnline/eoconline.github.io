<p>In times of disaster, a trained and informed public is better prepared to protect themselves, their families, their workplace and their neighbors. This webinar will showcase several disaster training resources that are available in communities across the nation. FEMA recognizes that it takes a “whole community” approach to meet the needs of the public before, during and after a disaster. Learn how your community can train and educate its citizens to be better prepared and involved in your community’s disaster response and recovery efforts.</p>
<p>Join us for brief presentations by representatives from the American Red Cross, the Community Emergency Response Team program, ARRL National Association for Amateur Radio (Ham Radio operators), Medical Reserve Corps, Meals on Wheels, HandsOn Network, Fire Corps, USAonWatch Neighborhood Watch program, Volunteers in Police Service, SkyWarn and more!</p>
