The goal is the first deliverable required under Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 8: National Preparedness, which was released in April 2011. The goal sets the vision for nationwide preparedness and identifies the core capabilities and targets necessary to achieve preparedness across five mission areas laid out under PPD 8: prevention, protection, mitigation, response and recovery.</p>  <p>&quot;As we work to build a more prepared nation, we must work with the entire community â€“the public and private sectors, faith-based and non-profit organizations, and most importantly the public,&quot; said FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate. &quot;This goal recognizes that reality, and we will continue to work with all our stakeholders to implement PPD 8 and build a more prepared and resilient nation.&quot;</p>  <p>FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate announced the release of the goal at the annual National Emergency Managers Association (NEMA) Conference in Austin, Texas.

This goal builds extensively on prior work of various stakeholder groups from around the nation, draws upon lessons learned from large-scale and catastrophic events and represent input from all stakeholders.</p>  <p>As directed by PPD 8, this goal will be reviewed regularly to ensure consistency with applicable policies, evolving conditions and the National Incident Management System.</p>  <p>For more information about PPD 8 and its implementation, visit <a href="http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=bWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTExMDEyLjMzNjU5MjEmbWVzc2FnZWlkPU1EQi1QUkQtQlVMLTIwMTExMDEyLjMzNjU5MjEmZGF0YWJhc2VpZD0xMDAxJnNlcmlhbD0xMjc3MTAyMzgzJmVtYWlsaWQ9ZmVtYS1taXRpZ2F0aW9uQHZhc2hvbmRlc2lnbi5jb20mdXNlcmlkPWZlbWEtbWl0aWdhdGlvbkB2YXNob25kZXNpZ24uY29tJmZsPSZleHRyYT1NdWx0aXZhcmlhdGVJZD0mJiY=&amp;&amp;&amp;110&amp;&amp;&amp;http://www.fema.gov/ppd8">www.fema.gov/ppd8</a>.</p>
