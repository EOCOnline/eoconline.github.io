Homeland Security Grant Program previously designated for Disaster Emergency Response Trailers (DERT) in King County, was re-allocated for Vashon! The trailer will primarily be used to store ADA compliant cots, blankets and pillows for use in community shelters to be set up for off-island visitors and workers unable to get home, or for residents with damaged houses.</p>
<p>Don Price (King County), Sarah Miller (Auburn), Jill Watson&#160;(Seattle)&#160;have been working with Catherine Rogers, Fire Chief Hank Lipe and myself since last summer for formal application for such a DERT from the 2011 grant cycle, but this additional allocation came as a very pleasant surprise. Cathy will be serving as project lead on purchasing and implementing procedures for its use.</p>
