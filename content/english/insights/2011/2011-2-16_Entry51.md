More is to come, and you can consult Chief Lipe or Exercise Czar Rick Wallace for all the details, but for now please just add the following dates to next year’s calendar:</p>
<h2>2012 Exercise Series</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Functional Exercise: June 5-6</li>
    <li>Logistics Drill: June 12-14</li>
    <li>Recovery TTX: August 15 &amp; 22</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Evergreen Quake is a series of three exercises that is intended to test the ability of local, state, federal and tribal governments, as well as select private sector entities located within the eight-county Puget Sound Metro Area to collaboratively respond to and recover from a large-scale to catastrophic Seattle Fault earthquake. The ultimate goal of the exercise-series is to improve the collective operational readiness of emergency/ disaster managers, and other public safety institutions that are participating in the exercise. The three exercises in the series and their tentative dates are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Functional Exercise (June 5-6, 2012)</li>
    <li>Logistics Exercise/Drill (June 12-14, 2012)</li>
    <li>Recovery Table Top Exercise (August 15 and August 22, 2012)</li>
</ul>

This will be the charge of the ‘Evergreen Quake’ Exercise Design Interagency Working Committee and its respective Subcommittees. Working together, Puget Sound Area city, county, state, federal, non governmental, and private sector officials that volunteer to serve on the various ‘Evergreen Quake’ exercise design and planning subcommittees will collaboratively build a realistic-as-possible set of exercises through the development of comprehensive scenario documents, a challenging Master Scenario Events List, and a&#160; robust simulation and control cell.</p>
