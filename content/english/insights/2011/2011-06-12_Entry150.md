A reprint on one side of this issue follows. (Note that VashonBePrepared has not taken a stance on this or any other legislative to date. We may in the future – our 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status only prevents us from spending a <a href="http://www.asaecenter.org/Resources/whitepaperdetail.cfm?ItemNumber=12202" target="_blank">“substantial” portion of our budget for influencing legislation</a>.)</p>  <p><b>The Politics of the D-Block: Now is the Time to Communicate with Your Members of Congress</b></p>  <p><img style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right" title="Bill Webb has served as Executive Director of the Congressional Fire Services Institute (CFSI) since 1995.

Webb, Executive Director, Congressional Fire Services Institute</a></i><i> </i></p>  <p>IF YOU WANT THE ASSURANCE OF COMMUNICATING WITH FELLOW FIRST RESPONDERS AT EMERGENCY SCENES, THEN NOW IS THE TIME TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: Securing the D Block for Public Safety</p>  <p>William M. Webb, Executive Director, Congressional Fire Services Institute</p>  <p>For the past 16 years, ever since I became Executive Director, I have had a dilettante’s understanding of the need for additional broadcast spectrum for public safety.&#160; I use the term “dilettante” because one needs to have been in an emergency situation to truly understand the dangers experienced by first responders as a result inoperable communication systems.&#160; I have not, nor for that matter have most of our elected leaders.&#160; So when I hear fire officials testify on Capitol Hill about the need for additional spectrum and how this additional spectrum can enhance communication systems for our first responders, I value their testimony above all others.</p>  <p>In recent months, public safety has been well represented in congressional hearings addressing proposals for a national broadband communication system.&#160; The uniforms worn by these officials convey a sense of credibility on the subject matter.&#160; The D Block, as articulated by these expert panelists, is not a want; it’s a genuine need.&#160; We have reached a critical juncture in the ongoing battle to secure additional spectrum for public safety and now is the time for individual fire service leaders to get engaged.</p>  <p>As many of you know, the battle is over 10 MHz of spectrum in the upper 700 MHz band known as the D block.&#160;&#160; Earlier in the year, public safety gained additional momentum for securing the D block when the Obama Administration shifted its position by proposing to set aside the D block for public safety in its Fiscal Year 2012 budget proposal.&#160; The proposal also included $10 billion to build-out and maintain the public safety broadband network. </p>  <p>Although the Obama Administration is now on board the D Block bandwagon in support of public safety, we have many more hurdles to clear before reaching the finish line of this protracted campaign.&#160; Legislation is required to prevent the Federal Communications Commission from auctioning the spectrum in the D block for commercial uses.&#160; If the auction occurs, public safety will have a difficult time building a reliable and secured nationwide interoperable public safety broadband network that will enable first responders access to time-critical data during large-scale emergencies.</p>  <p>On Capitol Hill, members of Congress have introduced legislation in both the House and Senate that would reallocate the 10 MHz of spectrum in the D block for public safety.&#160; Senator John Rockefeller (WV) introduced S.911 and Senator Joseph Lieberman (CT) introduced S. 1040 with bipartisan support.&#160; Both measures would clear the D Block for public safety use while setting aside federal funding from an auction of other spectrum to develop a broadband system.&#160; Congressman Peter King (NY-3) has introduced HR 607.&#160; King’s measure is similar to the two senate bills, clearing the D block for public safety use and providing federal funds through an auction to build a public safety broadband network system.</p>  <p>On June 8<sup>th</sup>, S. 911 cleared the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.&#160; The 21-4 vote affirms the level of bipartisan support in the Senate chamber.&#160; The measure now awaits the action of the full Senate. </p>  <p>Whereas all three measures have widespread support from a broad range of public safety organizations, trade associations, and local and state governments, support is not unanimous both within the communication sector and on Capitol Hill.&#160; Opponents offer a various reasons for their position.&#160; Following the vote on the Rockefeller measure, one Senator cautioned that “the nation’s debt would increase by more than $17 billion by the enactment of this legislation.”&#160; Conversely, proponents argue that the broadband network system would have a positive impact on the economy, creating an entirely new market for data-driven devices and applications, thereby stimulating competition, product innovation and entrepreneurship – three key factors that fuel our nation’s economic engine. </p>  <p>Public safety is within reach of achieving a major victory that will have a far-reaching impact on the paramount issue of building a 21<sup>st</sup> century broadband network for first responders.&#160; <b><i><u>21<sup>st</sup> century</u></i></b> is what drives this debate for public safety.&#160; The D block will allow us to build out a system using new technologies – some that might be in the conceptual stage –that will give public safety the cutting-edge technologies to respond to large-scale emergencies, allowing first responders on the scene access to mission-critical data that can save lives and reduce injuries and property loss.</p>  <p>But if Congress cannot approve the legislation pending in both the House and Senate and decides instead to allow the FCC to auction the D block to commercial bidders, public safety will be dealt a serious setback.&#160; Once the spectrum is auctioned-off, public safety will be at the mercy of the commercial service providers occupying the D block to gain access during critical events and emergencies.&#160; Is this a chance worth taking?&#160; Certainly not, given the threats we are now facing in a post 9/11 world.</p>  <p>Hence, members of the fire and emergency services need to start calling their representatives and urging them to set aside the D block for public safety.&#160; The Public Safety Alliance, a coalition of over 50 organizations and businesses advocating this cause, has information on their website discussing how fire service leaders and others can get engaged in this effort.&#160; The address is PSAFIRST.ORG.</p>  <p>The window of opportunity is starting to close on this issue.&#160; Your support is needed…now!</p>
