A voluntary organization administered by Public Health – Seattle &amp; King County, the Coalition is open to all organizations and individuals that provide or support health care services in King County.</p>  <p>The Seattle Times has a positive story about the King County Healthcare Coalition today:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>IF an earthquake, epidemic or other disaster struck, would hospitals here be open with plenty of beds, people and medical supplies? And would people know what to do? To some extent they would, because of the work of the King County Healthcare Coalition.</p>    <p>For more than five years, people from hospitals, clinics and Public Health of Seattle and King County have been working together on how to respond to disaster.</p>    <p>[…]</p>    <p>This is an effort that concerns the health, and lives, of thousands of people here. It deserves community support.</p> </blockquote>  <p align="right">Read the full story online at: <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/editorials/2015452560_edit29disasters.html">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/editorials/2015452560_edit29disasters.html</a></p>
