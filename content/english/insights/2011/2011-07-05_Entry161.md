<p>Begun in 2003 as the CERT Expo, the scope was broadened in 2008 to be a Citizen Corps Expo. The intended audience is trained and registered CERT volunteers, MRC medical professionals, and ham radio operators. The cost is $30, and includes a full-day of training and exercise, light breakfast, lunch, snacks and beverages. The NW Citizen Corps Expo 2011 is operating under Mission Number 11-T-336, which provides liability coverage to locally registered Emergency Workers.</p>
