<p><img title="" alt="" align="right" width="128" height="150" style="display: inline; float: right" src="http://www.gsnmagazine.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/fullsize/newmadridweb.png" /><a title="http://www.gsnmagazine.com/node/22726" href="http://www.gsnmagazine.com/node/22726">http://www.gsnmagazine.com/node/22726</a> describes a major multi-state, national exercise simulating the 1811 New Madrid earthquake â€“ actually a series of seismic events (up to seven on the Richter Scale) from December 1811 into 1812. According to FEMA, NLE 2011 will be the first NLE to simulate a natural hazard and also uses a <a href="http://www.ttregistration.com/osc2011/conference/techzone.cfm">state-based planning process rather than federal</a>.</p>
<p>From FEMA Administrator W. Craig Fugate comes word of a <a target="_blank" href="/Portals/1/Docs/FEMA/National_Exercise_Program_Base_Plan_(2011-03-18).pdf">new base plan</a> for such events, the National Exercise Program Base Plan, as updated a few weeks ago, on March 18. National standards for such exercises are coordinated through <a href="https://hseep.dhs.gov/pages/1001_HSEEP7.aspx">the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program (HSEEP)</a>.</p>
