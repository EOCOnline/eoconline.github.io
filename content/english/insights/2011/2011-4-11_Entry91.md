Fire Commissioners Rex Stratton, Gayle Summers, Ron Turner, David Hoffmann and Neal Phillip presented the award to General Joseph Ulatoski, Catherine and Michael Cochrane, Richard Wallace and myself on VashonBePrepared’s behalf. The award was clearly in recognition of all the volunteers and organizations that make our coalition thrive.</p>
<p>Rick Wallace and Michael Cochrane were also recognized for their 5 year anniversary as VIFR Associate Members. Presiding over the days festivities were Fire Commissioner Rex Stratton and Fire Chief Hank Lipe.</p>
