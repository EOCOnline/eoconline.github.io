<p>Washington, D.C., June 2, 2011 /PRNewswire/ — Up to 40% of businesses affected by a natural or man-made disaster never reopen, according to the Insurance Information Institute. In a nationwide effort to raise the business community’s awareness about how to prepare their businesses and employees in the event of an emergency, the Advertising Council, in partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the American Red Cross, announced today the launch of new public service advertisements (PSAs) on behalf of <em>Ready</em> <em>Business</em>.</p>

Unfortunately, small to medium-sized businesses are also the most vulnerable in the event of an emergency. An Ad Council survey reported that nearly two-thirds (62%) of respondents said they do not have an emergency plan in place for their business. By taking steps ahead of time, many of these businesses can be better prepared to survive and recover after an emergency.</p>
<p>“Businesses small and large make up the backbone of economies in communities across our country,” said FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate. “Putting a disaster plan in motion now will improve the likelihood that businesses and organizations will not only survive and recover themselves, but also help their neighbors and communities recover more quickly.”</p>

All of the PSAs direct audiences to visit <a href="http://www.ready.gov/business">www.ready.gov/business</a> for online resources, including the Red Cross Ready Rating business preparedness assessment tool. This free, interactive tool provides business owners with a clear picture of the preparedness level of their business and what further steps they need to take to get their business ready.</p>
<p>“We never know when or where disaster may strike, but we all want to be ready to protect our employees, families, and our communities,” said Gail McGovern, president and CEO of the Red Cross. “Everyone needs to play a role in emergency preparedness, and Ready Rating™ helps businesses and organizations understand if they are ready for an emergency.”</p>

<p>“We are proud to be associated with the important work FEMA is doing to educate Americans about being smart when it comes to preparing for disaster, especially at a time when many areas of the country are experiencing such dangerous and unpredictable weather,” said Brunner President Scott Morgan. “The creative dramatizes the aftereffects of a disaster in order to give small business owners a sense of the potential magnitude of the destruction. Our goal is to get them to be preemptive and develop a contingency plan well before disaster strikes.”</p>

Since its launch, media outlets have donated more than $129 million in advertising time and space for the PSAs. The new PSAs will air in advertising time that will be entirely donated by the media.</p>
