<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline" align="right" src="http://kingcounty.gov/transportation/kcdot/Roads/%7E/media/transportation/kcdot/roads/SnowAndIce/pha.ashx" width="358" height="239" />King County has told the local cities that it does not plan to provide snowplowing services to Tier 2 through 5 roads this winter due to budget cuts. <b><a href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/transportation/kcdot/Roads/NewServiceLevels/ServiceLevelsMap.aspx">Click here</a></b> to see which roads in unincorporated King County are currently identified as Tier 1 through 5, and to see contact information for questions. (Hint only Vashon Highway is rated as a tier one road.)</p>  <p>The County may in fact plow as resources become available, but is suggesting that it may not be in a timely fashion. Details on the county’s ice &amp; snow program can be found at: <a title="http://www.kingcounty.gov/transportation/kcdot/Roads/SnowAndIce.aspx" href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/transportation/kcdot/Roads/SnowAndIce.aspx">www.kingcounty.gov/transportation/kcdot/Roads/SnowAndIce.aspx</a></p>  <p>We are unaware of actual staffing changes locally so hope the stalwart Vashon crew will provide nearly the previous levels of service – despite the aforementioned policy statement. </p>
