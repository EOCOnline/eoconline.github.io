The orange image above shows the King County specific damage possible, while the table below shows the entire potential damage to the entire region.</p>  <p>A <a href="http://www.dnr.wa.gov/Publications/ger_seismic_scenario_tacoma.pdf" target="_blank">summary</a> and <a href="http://www.dnr.wa.gov/Publications/ger_hazus_seismic_scenario_tacoma.pdf" target="_blank">detailed report</a> of this scenario are available.

These scenarios were selected to represent reasonable estimates of the most serious earthquake hazards everywhere in Washington as a basis for planning. In most cases, these scenarios are realistic and have undergone rigorous peer review. Some of these scenarios, however, are hypothetical or speculative, and the recurrence interval, or average time between earthquakes, varies from a few tens of years to a few tens of thousands of years; however, all scenarios are consistent with data included the USGS National Seismic Hazard Map. The loss estimates were produced by Hazus-MH, which is a regional loss estimation tool produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Results are most accurate when aggregated on a county or regional scale. Modeled results depend on accurate inventories. The more complete the inventories, the more accurate the results. Because of their complexity, it is more difficult to estimate losses to lifelines (utility and transportation) than buildings. These data are not a substitute for site-specific investigations assessing the level of risk for an area. They cannot be used to determine the earthquake hazard at a specific locality. Such a determination requires a site-specific geotechnical investigation performed by a qualified practitioner.&#160; <br />&#160; <br />The effects from these and other earthquakes may vary significantly from what is depicted.       <br />&#160; <br />The Washington State Earthquake Hazards Scenario Catalog is the result of a collaborative effort by the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (WADNR), the Washington Military Department Emergency Management Division (EMD), Western Washington University (WWU), Huxley College of the Environment, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), US Geological Survey (USGS) and URS Corporation.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Local Press Coverage:</p>  <ul>   <li><a title="http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2021019310_quakescenariosxml.html" href="http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2021019310_quakescenariosxml.html">http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2021019310_quakescenariosxml.html</a> </li>    <li><a title="http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Just-how-devastating-will-earthquakes-be-in-4532382.php" href="http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Just-how-devastating-will-earthquakes-be-in-4532382.php">www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Just-how-devastating-will-earthquakes-be-in-4532382.php</a> </li> </ul>
