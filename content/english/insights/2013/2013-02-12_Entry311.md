She played a key role in the recovery of Joplin after the tornado took out 7,000 homes and 300 businesses. Vicky provides real life examples of how to be better prepared for disaster response. She will talk first-hand about their plan, show the magnitude of the tornado on their city and lessons learned. Vicky zeroes in on what are the pieces of a multi-level response hospitals need to be prepared to enact and what programs were most successful and why. Until you are in a disaster, you have no idea how to prepare but you can learn a lot from others' experiences as well as from the 911 reports. </p>            <p><strong>Kimberly Harris, CEO</strong> for Puget Sound Energy discusses the necessity of public-private partnerships and how developing the right partnership can create dynamic and lasting impacts.
