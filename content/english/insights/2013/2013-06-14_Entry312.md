ARES consists of licensed amateurs who voluntarily register their qualifications and equipment for public communications duty when disaster strikes. Internet, traditional and cell phones, email and other forms of modern communications are periodically disrupted – and often during emergencies. Amateur Radio provides the only consistent, decentralized and resilient communications backup for communities.</p>  <p>ARES chief, John Galus says, “Vashon’s ARES team has been involved in significantly more live activations this past year. Our frequent drills with Vashon Island Fire &amp; Rescue, CERT, MRC and VashonBePrepared has really improved our effectiveness and ability to efficiently respond to actual incidents. Communications help keep crises from becoming disasters.”</p>  <p><b></b></p>  <p><b>2013 Field Day</b></p>  <div>   <div align="right">     <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="300" align="right" border="0"><tbody>         <tr>           <td width="300">             <p align="center"><a href="/images/dnnBlog/1/312/Windows-Live-Writer-Vashon-Maury-Island-Radio-Club-Invites-Y_66DB-clip_image002_2.jpg"><img title="clip_image002" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="clip_image002" src="/images/dnnBlog/1/312/Windows-Live-Writer-Vashon-Maury-Island-Radio-Club-Invites-Y_66DB-clip_image002_thumb.jpg" width="244" height="128" /></a><b></b> </p>              <p align="center"><b><font size="1">Photo from 2011 Vashon Field Day</font></b></p>           </td>         </tr>       </tbody></table>   </div> On Saturday and Sunday June 22<sup>nd</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup>, VMIRC competes in ARRL’s Field Day event with thousands of amateur radio operators making radio contacts from community parks, campgrounds, schools and emergency centers throughout North America. </div>  <p>Open to the public, this is a great way for those curious about radio communications to see real operations, chat with operators and even try a call themselves.
