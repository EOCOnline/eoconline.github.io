<p><img width="383" height="371" title="King County Heat Map for this weekend shows a wide variance in temeratures through out the King County. Unfortunately, the county still sometimes forgets about us on Vashon Island!" align="right" style="border: 0px currentcolor; border-image: none; float: right; display: inline; background-image: none;" alt="King_County_Heat_Map" src="/portals/1/Graphics/WebSite/King_County_Heat_Map.png" border="0">An extended heat wave will affect Vashon and the rest of the Puget Sound this weekend with&nbsp; high temperatures above 105 degrees predicted Sunday and Monday.<p>Heat waves can be dangerous for elders, infants, people on medications, and people with health conditions that increase heat sensitivity, so it's important to take sensible precautions to avoid heat-related illness. <p>Here are some tips to beat the heat from Public Health -- Seattle &amp; King County and VashonBePrepared....<ul><li> Minimize physical exertion and do outdoor activities during the cooler morning hours.</li><li> Stay in the shade and keep sipping a cool non-alcoholic drink. Water is best.</li><li> Don't leave people or pets in the car, even with the windows rolled down.</li><li> Wear light, loose, breathable clothing, preferably cotton.</li><li> Check on others, to spot and respond to any signs of heat illness, such as nausea and confusion, dry hot flushed skin, and rapid pulse. </li><li> Practice water safety by using personal flotation devices, and remember the sunscreen.</li></ul><p>Few people in our area have air conditioning but you can improvise. You can make a simple evaporative cooler -- like a swamp cooler -- by draping a wet towel over a chair and aiming your fan at it so the cooled air blows your way. Remoisten the towel when it gets too dry to make cool air. <p>See the hot weather blog at Public Health Seattle - King County for more tips to beat the heat.<p><a href="https://kingcounty.gov/depts/health/emergency-preparedness/preparing-yourself/hot-weather.aspx">https://kingcounty.gov/depts/health/emergency-preparedness/preparing-yourself/hot-weather.aspx</a></p>
