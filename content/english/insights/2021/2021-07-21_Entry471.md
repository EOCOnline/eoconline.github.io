Additionally, this service can be used for job searches, telehealth, telework, unemployment filing, and census participation.<p>The locations listed on this map represent new Drive-In WiFi Hotspot sites located at Washington State University Extension locations, as well as new and existing Drive-In WiFi Hotspots. <p>Launching primarily as parking lot hotspots in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the free community Wi-Fi is accessible regardless of how users arrive at the locations. Some sites also offer indoor public access during business hours. Everyone using the sites – outside or inside – must practice social distancing and hygiene precautions, including staying in your vehicle or at least six feet from other users and wearing a mask if necessary.<p>Each hotspot will have its own security protocol. Some will be open and others will have Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) safe security installed. For public library drive-in wifi spots, please contact the public library system directly if you encounter difficulties or have questions.<p>Broadband equity is not just a rural challenge. The drive-In Wi-Fi hotspot project addresses underserved and economically disadvantaged communities in urban and suburban areas as well.<hr><p><em>The Washington State Broadband Office estimates over 300 new drive-in Wi-Fi hotspots are coming online statewide through an initiative to bring free public broadband internet access to all residents. Partners in the state’s drive-in Wi-Fi hotspots project include: Washington State University; Washington State Library, part of the Washington Office of the Secretary of State; members of the Washington Public Utility Districts Association (WPUDA) and affiliated nonprofit Northwest Open Access Network (NoaNet); the Washington State Broadband Office; Washington Independent Telecommunications Association (WITA); Washington Technology Solutions (WaTech); and the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI). Microsoft and the Avista Foundation are providing funding, and the Information Technology Disaster Resource Center (ITDRC), a national nonprofit contributed equipment and installation.</em>
