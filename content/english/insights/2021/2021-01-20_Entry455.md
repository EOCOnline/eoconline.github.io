<p>The EOC is trying hard to keep the vaccination information page updated at: <a href="https://vashonbeprepared.org/COVID-Vaccine">https://vashonbeprepared.org/COVID-Vaccine</a>. </p><p>Please take note that the Pharmacy operation is going to get a lot of attention because it's convenient and open wide. But other options do exist, including Sea Mar and Vashon Natural Medicine as well as a number of mainland operations...everything from Kaiser, to CVS and Safeway Pharmacy, etc. </p><p>Please know this: For some time to come the demand will exceed the available supply being allocated by the federal government and thus available to the state Department of Health. </p><p>And...one last thing...gigantic shoutout to Sea Mar. They got 120 doses initially. And they spent the last week searching out Phase 1A eligible folks and calling them in to their clinic to get vaccinated...health care providers, dentists, first responders, etc., etc. </p><p>That's real community sharing!</p><p>- Rick Wallace</p>
