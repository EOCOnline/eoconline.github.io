<p>Washington Governor Jay Inslee signed a new amendment into law on Tuesday, and it will take effect 7/25/21. <p>Here’s the link to the formal wording and the RCW citation for future reference. <a href="http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1209-S.SL.pdf#page=1">http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1209-S.SL.pdf#page=1</a><p>Remember this is the section that applies to people helping their neighbors in a “it’s a disaster” situation, not the people who have protections as a Registered Emergency Worker (their coverage is in a different section).<p>Our appreciation to West Seattle Be Prepared neighbor Cindi Barker for her efforts to get this passed in this year’s busy legislative session.</p>
