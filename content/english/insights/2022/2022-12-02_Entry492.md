[https://inspecttoprotect.org/international-residential-codes/](https://inspecttoprotect.org/international-residential-codes/ "https://inspecttoprotect.org/international-residential-codes/") is a free online tool sponsored by DHS and provided by Federal Alliance for Safe Homes.

Once at their website, enter your address and it will suggest a series of fixes – above and beyond what our current building codes suggest.

It also provides an interesting snapshot of historical disasters for the region.
