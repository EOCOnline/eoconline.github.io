[Hina Kilioni](mailto:HinaKilioni@rentonwa.gov) and I just had a great chat on a whole range of topics, but most significantly on his desire to facilitate communications among regional disaster organizations.

As I mentioned to him there are a ton of examples and models for how we each are organized. It wasn’t until I started compiling a list that I discovered I only knew about a third of them!

- [National Citizen Corps](https://www.ready.gov/citizen-corps)

And I’m just scratching the surface of the Internet river…

I’ve also just heard there that we have a new (as of May) State Citizen Corps/CERT Coordinator, [Celso Rangel](mailto:Celso.Rangel@ofm.wa.gov).

I don’t think I’ve ever (since helping start VashonBePrepared back in 2007) heard of any general email or meeting of Washington Citizen Corps Councils, and I guess August 21, 2021 FEMA put out a notice declaring the entire Citizen Corps program (aside from CERT) as moribund, but I for one would love to see it championed.

More on this as we work on a plan. I’d love to hear from others also interested in this idea.
