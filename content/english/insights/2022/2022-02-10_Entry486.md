<p><a href="mailto:HinaKilioni@rentonwa.gov">Hina Kilioni</a> and I just had a great chat on a whole range of topics, but most significantly on his desire to facilitate communications among regional disaster organizations.</p><p>As I mentioned to him there are a ton of examples and models for how we each are organized.
