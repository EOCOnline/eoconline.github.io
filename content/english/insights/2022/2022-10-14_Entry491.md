![Drop, Cover, Hold On](https://www.shakeout.org/images/dropcoverholdon_eng_white.png)

This year's International ShakeOut Day is October 20, when millions of people worldwide will participate in [earthquake](https://mil.wa.gov/earthquake) drills at work, school, or home!

At 10:20 am (local time) on 10/20, you can join millions of people across Washington practicing [earthquake safety](https://www.shakeout.org/washington/dropcoverholdon). While we encourage you to participate with everyone, you can [register](https://www.shakeout.org/washington/register) your ShakeOut drill for any day of the year, and drill at a time of your choice. You can also include people in multiple locations through video conferencing.

If you live or work in a coastal area, ShakeOut day is also a great time to practice your [tsunami](https://mil.wa.gov/tsunami) evacuation routes. Learn more about tsunami preparedness at [TsunamiZone.org](https://www.tsunamizone.org/washington).
