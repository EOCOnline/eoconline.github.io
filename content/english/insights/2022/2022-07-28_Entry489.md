<p>The Excessive Heat Warning issued by the National Weather Service has been extended one more day through Saturday evening. High temperatures over the next several days are forecast in the range of 90 to 94 degrees. There will be relief overnight as temperatures fall into the low sixties.<p>The National Weather Service classifies this as a level three heat risk event out of a possible four levels in the National Weather Service classification system.
