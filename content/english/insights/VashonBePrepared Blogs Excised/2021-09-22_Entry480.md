There are many ways to engage your family, friends, <br>neighbors, community, and volunteer groups <br>on preparedness. </p><blockquote><p><font size="4">Go to </font><a title="https://vashonbeprepared.org/en-us/Help-Out/Volunteer" href="https://vashonbeprepared.org/Help-Out/Volunteer"><font size="4">https://vashonbeprepared.org/Help-Out/Volunteer</font></a><font size="4"> to get involved!</font></p></blockquote><p>Youth are leaders in preparedness.
