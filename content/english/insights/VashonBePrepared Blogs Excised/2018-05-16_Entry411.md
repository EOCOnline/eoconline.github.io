<div style="color: #222222;">Happy Spring! This lovely weather is a reminder that&nbsp;<strong>summer block party season</strong>&nbsp;is just around the corner. Calendars fill quickly in the mild seasons, but we're eager to help with preparedness activities in your neighborhood, so if you are planning a block party or other neighborhood gathering, and would like any of: a presenter, handouts, visual aids, any other information relevant to your group or neighborhood, please let me know as soon as possible.&nbsp;</div>
<p style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #1d2129;"><br />
</span></p>
<p style="color: #222222;"><span style="color: #1d2129;">There are numerous Vashon-Maury neighborhoods where folks know each other, but we may not know about you. Please let us know your group's status, and your status as a captain or leader. Is your group still active? (have you gotten together in the past year?) Are you personally still leading your group? Do you have a co-leader/co-captain who would also like to be on the NERO email list? Did you move to a new neighborhood? (Do we have your current address?) Would you like help organizing or reviving your NERO group? Does your neighborhood have specific areas of concern that we can help address? So many questions... we hope to hear from you. Email to: nero@vashonbeprepared.org</span></p>
