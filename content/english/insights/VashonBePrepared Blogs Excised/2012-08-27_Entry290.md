Photo ff_1283063 by John Cornelison" src="./images/290/Windows-Live-Writer-d3d8edad8623_4FAF-ff_1283063_thumb.jpg" /></a>After some 7 years in a conference room in VIFR&rsquo;s main Station 55, the Vashon Emergency Operations Center (EOC) may be relocated next year to the VIFR Association Building across the street. Slightly larger, the room would be shared with King County services including a once-a-month courtroom and sheriff facilities. Extensive remodeling would perhaps finally alleviate our perennial storage issues!</p>
<p>The next step in the process, which has been in discussions for nearly a year, will be a decision by the King County Council, according to <a href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/exec/news/release/2012/August/02VashonRuralServiceCenter.aspx" target="_blank">King County&rsquo;s August 2nd press release</a>. The <a href="http://www.vashonbeachcomber.com/community/165304186.html" target="_blank">Vashon Beachcomber published</a> additional coverage on August 7th.</p>
<p><em>[8/20/12 Update: The legislation will be heard on Sept. 5<sup>th</sup> in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kingcounty.gov/council/committees/budget.aspx" target="_blank">Budget &amp; Fiscal Management Committee</a> - not Aug 21st as originally thought. This isn't reflected in <a href="http://mkcclegisearch.kingcounty.gov/custom/king/calendar.htm" target="_blank">the current agenda</a>, but presumably will be incorporated by the meeting time.]</em></p>
<p>If approved by the King County Council, the VIFR building, located at 100th Avenue SW and SW Bank Road, will house a King County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office substation, as well as provide space for King County District Court activities, the Vashon Community Service Center, King County Community Service Area staff, and for residents seeking help with permits from the Department of Development and Environmental Services (DDES) and County licenses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a rural, unincorporated community in King County, the needs of Vashon residents are often unique. This proposed new space would help to better meet these needs and help to streamline County government,&rdquo; said King County Councilmember Joe McDermott. </p>
