[![NWCCExpo](./images/414/2018-Citizen-Corps-Expo_A084-NWCCExpo_thumb.jpg "NWCCExpo")](./images/414/2018-Citizen-Corps-Expo_A084-NWCCExpo_2.jpg)Over a decade ago, about 75 enthusiastic CERT volunteers came out to the Evergreen State Fairgrounds in Monroe, Snohomish County, for the day. That memorable day, in 2003, was the first CERT Expo. The CERT Expo evolved to include continuing education sessions in the morning and participation by volunteers in a disaster exercise in the afternoon.  In 2005, the CERT Expo expanded and moved to the Everett Community College. Our intrepid volunteers spread the word about the Expo and, in 2007, the Expo moved to the Washington State Fire Training Academy, in North Bend, to accommodate the growing participation of CERT volunteers from across the state. Children’s Hospital and the State Citizen Corps joined us as partners, which allowed us to extend our offerings. The focus was on skill refreshers through training and disaster exercises.

Since 2008, the Expo has expanded to include Citizen Corps partners and affiliates from across the Northwest: including participants from Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Canada.  Each year, with the help of our sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff, we train hundreds of disaster response volunteers on key emergency response skills, preparing them to assist when the need arises in their own communities. By 2010, over 200 people were actively training and participating in the Expo.

![EMD Logo](https://reg.abcsignup.com/files/B9CBE761-ECED-4C89-849B-923BDD5B7B85_38/EMD_Logo.png)The need for emergency preparedness has been front and center in the news with the SR-530 mudslide, wildfires and flooding and the threat of tsunamis and a Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquake. Changing weather patterns increase the risk for extreme weather events and, no matter where we live, natural disasters can strike at any time.

True to the calling to community service, our numbers continue to grow. We expect more volunteers from all over the West and Northwest to participate this year!
