For the first time it gives detailed predictions for sea level rise that is mapped throughout Washington’s coast line, including Puget Sound.</p>  <p>Vashon is covered by 6 overlapping study regions, as shown in the map to the right. </p>  <p>Click on the map (may only work for some browsers, like Chrome) and then click on one of the circles representing the area you are interested in. A Google docs spreadsheet should open up providing probabilities of sea level rise decade by decade for that selected area. Note the spreadsheet has 3 tabs on the bottom.</p>  <p><a href="./images/415/Windows-Live-Writer-UW-Report-on-Sea-Level-Rise-Projections_78CD-image_4.png"><img title="image" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="./images/415/Windows-Live-Writer-UW-Report-on-Sea-Level-Rise-Projections_78CD-image_thumb.png" width="634" height="858" /></a></p>  <blockquote>   <p>“The new report provides probabilistic estimates for 171 coastal sites each decade from now until 2150. The analysis follows two previous assessments of sea-level rise in the state: the <a href="http://dels.nas.edu/Report/Level-Rise-Coasts/13389">2012 national report</a> for sea-level rise in Washington, Oregon and California, and a <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/puget-sound-to-creep-up-up/">2008 report</a> led by the UW <a href="https://cig.uw.edu/">Climate Impacts Group</a>. In addition to updating the science, the new report offers more detail on what to expect at specific locations.</p>    <p>“The study follows a 2015 UW <a href="http://www.washington.edu/news/2015/11/17/new-report-outlines-puget-sound-regions-future-under-climate-change/">report</a> on how climate change will affect Puget Sound. This new study provides much greater detail about sea-level rise, both in Puget Sound and along the coast.</p>    <p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline" alt="Google Map of Washington" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/uw-s3-cdn/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/07/27153935/map_of_sites2.png" width="367" align="right" height="274" />“Previous assessments were zoomed out, and were not fine-scale enough to capture the variations in land movement along the coastlines,” said second author <a href="https://cig.uw.edu/news-and-events/about/people/harriet-morgan/">Harriet Morgan</a>, a research consultant with the UW Climate Impacts Group. “Neah Bay is rising, and south Puget Sound is sinking. That up and down movement has a pretty big influence on how far the ocean will be able to travel inland.”</p>    <p>- <a title="http://www.washington.edu/news/2018/07/30/sea-level-rise-report-contains-best-projections-yet-for-washingtons-coasts/" href="http://www.washington.edu/news/2018/07/30/sea-level-rise-report-contains-best-projections-yet-for-washingtons-coasts/">www.washington.edu/news/2018/07/30/sea-level-rise-report-contains-best-projections-yet-for-washingtons-coasts/</a></p> </blockquote>  <p>The actual report is at:</p>  <p><a title="http://www.wacoastalnetwork.com/wcrp-documents.html" href="http://www.wacoastalnetwork.com/wcrp-documents.html">http://www.wacoastalnetwork.com/wcrp-documents.html</a></p>  <p>and articles about it are at:</p>  <p><a title="http://www.washington.edu/news/2018/07/30/sea-level-rise-report-contains-best-projections-yet-for-washingtons-coasts/" href="http://www.washington.edu/news/2018/07/30/sea-level-rise-report-contains-best-projections-yet-for-washingtons-coasts/">http://www.washington.edu/news/2018/07/30/sea-level-rise-report-contains-best-projections-yet-for-washingtons-coasts/</a></p>  <p><a title="https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/matt-driscoll/article215767485.html" href="https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/matt-driscoll/article215767485.html">https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/matt-driscoll/article215767485.html</a></p>  <p><a title="https://komonews.com/news/local/sea-level-could-rise-up-to-3-feet-in-seattle-study-says" href="https://komonews.com/news/local/sea-level-could-rise-up-to-3-feet-in-seattle-study-says">https://komonews.com/news/local/sea-level-could-rise-up-to-3-feet-in-seattle-study-says</a></p>  <p><img alt="This table shows the projections for feet of sea-level rise by 2100, taking into account geologically-driven vertical land motion, at three locations on Washington&#39;s coasts: Tacoma, Neah Bay and Taholah on the Quinault River.
