Participation in CERT is highly rewarding. If community support when problems arise is important to you, CERT will likely be an extraordinarily positive experience.

CERT originated in Los Angeles in 1994 to support the city fire department, and has been enhanced and extended to hundreds of communities by FEMA to train citizens to safely volunteer in various emergencies.

## Rewards of being on the active team:

- Increased safety at your home & business
- Increased personal preparedness for windstorms, earthquakes and power outages
- New life-saving and first aid skills
- Increased self-confidence
- New friends
- Participation in the Vashon community Stylish green hard-hat and hi-vis vest (for team)

## Requirements to be on the team:

- Vashon resident – full-time or part-time
- Very basic physical fitness
- Basic CERT course (3 parts described on this flyer)
- Several additional Vashon-specific trainings (maps, two-way radios, search & rescue practice, etc.)

## Typical activations include

- Search for missing persons (Vashon has no other local search/rescue group)
- Logistical support to the Fire Dept. or Sheriff
- Information gathering during a disaster; First aid and information stations

## CERT does not…

fight fires, go into unstable buildings, or neglect our own neighborhoods. CERT members are specially trained to be a skilled resource in their neighborhoods, and respond to the greater community only after their own home and neighborhood are stable.
