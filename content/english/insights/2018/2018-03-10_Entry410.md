# March 31 - Free Seminar

## [![image](./images/410/Disaster-Preparedness-March-31---Free-Se_CC2E-image_thumb.png "image")](./images/410/Disaster-Preparedness-March-31---Free-Se_CC2E-image_2.png)Severe weather or an earthquake WILL create these Vashon conditions:

- The power out for days or longer
- Homes damaged, roads closed
- Phones not working well or at all
- Our Fire Department overloaded with emergency responses
- Ferries stop serving Vashon – docks may be damaged or boats needed elsewhere
- Gas, supplies and groceries not arriving from the mainland
- Families separated – some folks stranded off-island; many can’t get to work

## Learn the ropes to be resilient – not to mention well-fed!

Four hours packed with resources, advice & island information: Saturday, March 31 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.

Farcy Training Center at main campus of Vashon Fire & Rescue on Bank Rd.

Free – and open to everyone

Bring a snack and your water bottle (very short breaks; no lunch break)
