The ever-popular **CERT Preparedness Seminar** will be offered again on March 31, from 9 am to 2 pm. It also serves as the first in a series of classes that comprise Vashon's rigorous and empowering CERT (Community Emergency Response Organization) training program. (To enroll in the whole CERT course, contact CERT manager Jan Milligan at cert@vashonbeprepared.org).

The preparedness seminar will be held at the Penny Farcy training center, on Bank Rd right across from the main fire station. Leaders from CERT, Emergency Operations, Auxiliary Communications, NERO, and of course VIFR, will present on topics ranging from household and neighborhood preparedness, and communications challenges and solutions when cell or landline service are disrupted, to gas and electric safety during a storm or other outage, and home fire safety.

The class is free, open to the public, and there will only be a brief lunch break, so please bring a bag lunch or snack.

Sign up with Jan at cert@vashonbeprepared.org.

If you can't make it, watch for a repeat of this stand-alone preparedness class in the fall.
