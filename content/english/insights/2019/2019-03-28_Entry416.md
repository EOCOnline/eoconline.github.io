The ability to survive, to care for the injured and sick, may well depend on how well we help our island communities prepare.</p>  <p>This conference intends to continue the dialogue among health care providers we must have about preparing for disasters - earthquakes to be sure, but also increasing storm and forest fire risks in a time of climate change, epidemics, and behavioral health challenges.</p>  <h2><font style="font-weight: bold">Bringing together Salish Sea islands' health care professionals</font></h2>  <p>Our speakers will include Vashon Island historian <a href="http://www.vashonhistory.com/">Bruce Haulman</a>, ER physician <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-french-md-ms-facep-chse-559418b">Arthur French MD</a> who served in New Orleans after Katrina, and ER physician <a href="https://www.uwmedicine.org/bios/stephen-morris">Stephen Morris MD who</a> focuses on regional disaster preparedness such as <a href="https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/128345">Cascadia Rising Exercise.</a>&#160; This conference intends to expand the dialogue and learn from what others are doing to help their island communities throughout the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salish_Sea">Salish Sea </a>prepare for disaster.</p>  <p><strong><em>This conference will be recorded for public education purposes and broadcast on various outlets.</em></strong></p>
