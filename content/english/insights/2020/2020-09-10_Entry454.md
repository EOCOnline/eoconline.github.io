<p>Here is a fire and smoke map that updates hourly using a variety of sources, including satellite. <p>It’s centered on Oregon when you first pull it up, but if you scroll up you’ll find Washington. You can see the Sumner Grade Fire in Bonney Lake and the newer fire southeast of Enumclaw. <p>If you zoom out, you can clear see the entire west coast on fire. ☹<p><a href="https://data.statesmanjournal.com/fires/">https://data.statesmanjournal.com/fires/</a></p>
