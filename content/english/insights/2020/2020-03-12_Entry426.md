<p>Every one should read this!</p><p><a href="/Portals/_default/Partners/MRC/Pierce Snohomish and Seattle King County Community Mitigation.pdf?ver=2020-03-12-165213-023" target="_blank">Click here to download “CDC’s Recommendations for the next 30 days of Mitigation Strategies for Seattle-King, Pierce and Snohomish Counties based on current situation with widespread COVID-19 transmission and affected health care facilities”</a></p>
<p>Bottom Line Up Front<br>&nbsp; Due to widespread transmission in Seattle, Washington, CDC recommends extensive community mitigation activities to support slowing the spread of respiratory virus infections. These approaches are used to minimize morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19 and minimize social and economic impacts of COVID-19. </p><p>Individuals, communities, businesses, and healthcare organizations are all part of a community mitigation strategy. Given the widespread community transmission in Seattle, WA, and the extensive involvement of health care facilities, especially nursing facilities at the epicenter, substantial interventions for both community (Table) and health care settings (appendix A) should be implemented at this time, based on the urgency of protecting the health care system with expected rise in cases by slowing the spread within the community.</p><p>Implementation emphasizes:<br>
• Emphasizing individual responsibility for implementation of recommended personal-level actions,<br>
• Empowering businesses, schools, and community organizations to implement recommended actions, particularly in ways that protect persons at risk of severe illness such as older adults and persons with<br>
2<br>
serious underlying health conditions (e.g., people requiring dialysis , or those with congestive heart failure or emphysema)<br>
• Focusing on settings that provide critical services to implement recommended actions to protect critical infrastructure and individuals at risk of severe disease<br>
• Minimizing disruptions to daily life to the extent possible</p>
