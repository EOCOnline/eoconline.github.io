Currently rated “The #1 Most Downloaded Emergency Contact Information App” for Apple iPhone, the ICE Standard App protects users during an emergency by featuring critical information as a screensaver.</p>  <p>In the event of an emergency, the ICE Standard App is designed to save lives by providing first time responders with immediate access to critical information about a patient. To help responders quickly identify a person’s condition, the App uses a tricolor system: Green (Good to Go), Yellow (Caution: Medications), and Red (Stop: Special Medical Condition or Life Threatening Allergies). </p>  <p>In addition, ICE Standard offers features to display one’s emergency contact information, blood type, medications, allergies, medical history, and power of attorney. The card and App also include a space for users to upload a photo I.D. for emergency identification.</p>  <p>“The information provided on the ICE Standard App is extremely helpful when in the field. It allows us to get information about the patient quickly and start administering the appropriate care sooner,” commented Robert Amjad, Emergency Medical Technician and Emergency Standard board member.</p>  <p>Joseph A. Ekman, CEO and Founder of ICE Standard, created The Emergency Standard Card and ICE Standard App after becoming permanently disabled and realizing the need to improve our nation’s emergency standards. “The lack of adequate and easily accessible medical data in critical circumstances is a looming defect in our nation’s medical response system. With The Emergency Standard Card and ICE Standard App, we can better protect ourselves and save lives,” stated Mr. Ekman.</p>  <p>To help establish ICE Standard as the official guide to locating a person's medical information, About the Kids Foundation has been reaching out to local emergency response teams and promoting the free ICE Standard App to download, as well as the purchase of The Emergency Standard Card. </p>  <p>To download the ICE Standard App on an Apple iPhone, visit the Apple Store at <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ice-standard-the-emergency/id412786820?mt=8&amp;ls=1#">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ice-standard-the-emergency/id412786820?mt=8&amp;ls=1#</a>. </p>  <p>To order The Emergency Standard Card, call (408) 736-4266 or visit <a href="http://www.EmergencyStandard.com">http://www.EmergencyStandard.com</a> Individual cards sell for $5.00 each, or the introductory special price of $8.50 for a complete 4-card family package.
