The course also discusses the benefits of structural and non-structural earthquake mitigation. After completing the course, participants should be able to describe what causes earthquakes, differentiate between hazards and vulnerabilities, identify potential vulnerabilities in their homes and businesses, and take additional steps toward reducing their overall risk. Short quizzes are included to enhance interactivity and to boost retention.</p>  <p><em>Earthquake Basics</em> is targeted to a wide range of audiences, including homeowners, business owners, the private sector, the federal, state, tribal, and local government workforce at all levels, first responders, non-profit organizations, volunteers, and community-based organizations. <em>Earthquake Basics</em> resides on the FEMA Emergency Management Institute (EMI) website, <a href="http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/IS/is325.asp" target="_blank">IS-325—Earthquake Basics: Science, Risk, and Mitigation</a>.</p>  <p>For information on other earthquake training courses and assistance, visit <a href="http://www.fema.gov/national-earthquake-hazards-reduction-program/national-earthquake-technical-assistance-program" target="_blank">National Earthquake Technical Assistance Program</a>.</p>  <p>To view or download NEHRP publications and products, or to sign up for updates on earthquake risk mitigation publications, news, and events, visit <a href="http://www.fema.gov/earthquake-publications" target="_blank">Earthquake Publications</a>.</p>  <p>   <hr /></p>  <h4>General Outline of Mitigation Steps</h4>  <h5>Mitigation: Identify Risk</h5>  <p>• Assess -Do an assessment, or have a professional, such as a structural engineer or contractor, do an assessment, of the building to determine the potential problems.</p>  <h5>Make a Plan</h5>  <p>• Mitigation plan -Plan what measures you can take to address the risks you have identified.   <br />• Earthquake Plan -Create a plan for during and after the earthquake.</p>  <h5>Take action</h5>  <p>• Mitigate -Address, or have a professional address, the issues or prepare to deal with the consequences.   <br />• Post-earthquake evaluation -Evaluate, or have a professional evaluate, the building and its contents.    <br />• Repair -If necessary, repair damaged elements. Rebuild stronger, so you won't have to rebuild again!</p>
