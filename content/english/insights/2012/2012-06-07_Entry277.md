<p>It was fairly historic for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>- Initial test of <em>Operation Lifeline</em> (King County&rsquo;s redirecting their passenger ferry or hiring a barge &ndash; to support emergency needs on Vashon) </li>
    <li>- The Planning Section has adopted the standard ICS&nbsp;Planning Clock - and had the 1st real run-though of&nbsp;this during a major exercise </li>
    <li>- The Public Information Team included VoiceOfVashon's alert team which provided a wealth of new knowledge and energy </li>
    <li>- First time we've invited local merchants (Vashon's Chamber of Commerce Director Debi Richards&nbsp;served as host) to observe both day's play. They&nbsp;gained a&nbsp;new level of appreciation for the gravity of the situation. </li>
    <li>- Much broader&nbsp;regional participation with WA State EOC support and FEMA oversight </li>
    <li>- 1st two day exercise (we've had maybe 4 or 5 all-day exercises before - but none lasted over&nbsp;6 hours) </li>
    <li>- Exercise play started on the second day of the incident - once more was known and providing a better chance for problem solving and regional coordination.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>- 1st use of King County&rsquo;s SharePoint system to enter resource requests</li>
    <li>- Probably more - we were all in collaboration and learning mode</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of our partners were directly involved including VIFR, MRC, VOV, VEPC &amp;&nbsp;CERT.&nbsp;Over a dozen ARRL licensed ham radio operators took part - but this is routine! While past events had us focus on having basic information available and some presence, we've moved on to infomation sharing (several years ago), to interacting with VIFR, then CERT and LACCs, then the county (especially with resource requests) and state - but this time we really were problem solving as teams from a variety of desks.</p>
<p>More volunteers are needed to cover the long hours of a real 24 hour a day&nbsp;event, but there are now a large number&nbsp;of experienced people and we've some very solid relationships with the professionals at the county and state level. Mow we just need to keep this up through the next major earthquake!</p>
