Geologists have documented some 22 megaquakes over the last 10,000 years - every 200 to 1,000 years, averaging some 500 years. The <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/pp1707/" title="The Orphan Tsunami of 1700&mdash;Japanese Clues to a Parent Earthquake in North America U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper No. 1707 (2005)" target="_blank">region&rsquo;s last</a> was on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1700_Cascadia_earthquake" target="_blank">January 26, 1700</a>.</p>
<p>This topic was explored last Sunday in Vancouver, BC in the &ldquo;<a href="http://aaas.confex.com/aaas/2012/webprogram/Session5186.html" target="_blank">The Magnitude 9.0 Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami: Significance for Japan and the World</a>&rdquo; symposium &ndash; part of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>

</ul>
<p>Researchers suggested that a Cascadia megaquake (geographically very similar to the Japanese site) could result in stronger shaking than previously expected along the coasts of Washington, Oregon and British Columbia.</p>
