Read the <a href="http://www.emd.wa.gov/training/documents/EQESOverview04-18-12.pdf">Evergreen Quake Overview</a> (PDF) for additional information.</p>    <p><a href="http://www.emd.wa.gov/training/documents/EQESOverviewv03-22-2012.pptx"><strong>EQES 2012 Executive Overview</strong></a> (PPT)</p> </blockquote>  <p>Our huge thanks go to Rick Wallace in representing VashonBePrepared not only at the county level but also the state level for his months of effort in this effort.</p>  <p>I’m not sure if it is ironic or sad, but without such drills, we would not have had an opportunity to actually test out Operation Lifeline – getting a passenger ferry or barge to serve the island’s needs until the regular ferry service might resume. Without the drill, we might not have a phone list of all key contacts in the region – much less the personal relationships that really help in a disaster - once regular channels of business are disrupted. By preparing for a drill we get so much done that would also need to be done for a true disaster. </p>  <p>The three exercises in the EQES series are:    <br />• Functional Exercise (June 5-6, 2012)    <br />• Logistics Exercise (June 12-14, 2012)     <br />• Recovery Tabletop Exercise (August 8 &amp; 22, 2012)</p>  <p>Have a great exercise everyone tomorrow!</p>
