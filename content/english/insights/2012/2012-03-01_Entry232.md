The original research was done by the <a href="http://www.persuadables.com/" target="_blank">Persuadable Research Corporation</a> with reports of the survey released by <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/disaster-preparedness/market-research-2012/prweb9225008.htm" target="_blank">PRWeb</a> and the <a href="http://www.homelandsecuritynewswire.com/srdisasters20120229-study-finds-majority-of-americans-unprepared-for-disasters" target="_blank">Homeland Security News Wire</a>.</p>
<p>This is exactly the kind of attitude a new VashonBePrepared public education campaign on preparedness is aimed to overcome. Adopted in concept at our board meeting last night, a great team of volunteers is now working to craft an evolving message to educate Vashon-Maury islanders about the risks and how to prepare their families, homes, neighbors, business and ultimately the community to weather future severe events. Stay tuned for details &ndash; or contact Bob Smueles, Erin Durrett, or Jeromy Sander to volunteer!</p>
