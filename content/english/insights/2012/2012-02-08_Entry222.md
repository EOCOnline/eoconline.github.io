Getting a handle on the true changes due to global warming requires massive statistical and scientific analyses.</p>  <p>The NCAR site delves into topics such as “Extreme weather forensics”, are we “Doping the atmosphere”, “Is this Climate Change?”, “Risky Business” and many more.</p>  <p>The United States endured a record 14 disasters in 2011 that each inflicted at least $1 billion in damage, according to NOAA in their <a href="http://www.noaa.gov/extreme2011/">http://www.noaa.gov/extreme2011/</a> web site on the various disasters last year. Last year saw more such mega-disasters than during all the 1980’s combined.</p>  <p>Experts note that the evidence can be strong or weak, depending on the type of weather. Researchers admit there are no clear answers. &quot;This is a very complicated subject,&quot; said David Hosansky, spokesman for the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, which produced the report and operates the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. &quot;We were convinced that these different messages could confuse the public and leave the people thinking that we just can't connect the dots. And in fact, a lot of the dots <i>are</i> being connected.&quot; </p>  <p>Read more at <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/global-warming-climate-scientists-effect-weather-steroids/story?id=15534047" target="_blank">an ABC News story on this</a> or see the new site itself at: <a title="https://www2.ucar.edu/atmosnews/attribution" href="https://www2.ucar.edu/atmosnews/attribution">www2.ucar.edu/atmosnews/attribution</a>.</p>
