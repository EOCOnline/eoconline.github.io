<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/10/obama-has-declared-record-breaking-89-disasters-so-far-in-2011/" target="_blank">President Obama has declared</a> 20 more disasters than in 2010 and 2 times the numbers declared by President George W. Bush in his first two years in the White House. </p>  <p>Are there really that many more disasters though? Despite all the severe weather this year and portent for much more ahead (partially due to <a href="http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20120913/NEWS02/120919931" target="_blank">massive declines in Artic Ice levels</a>) and resultant economic losses (e.g., a <a href="seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2019149639_apakalaskasalmondisasterdeclaration2ndldwritethru.html" target="_blank">huge downturn in salmon runs</a>), there may also be some politics at play, with Obama being pressured to declare disasters according to this <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/obama-declared-record-breaking-99-disasters-2011/story?id=17230545" target="_blank">ABC News report</a>.</p>
