During the recent earthquakes in Chile, New Zealand, Japan, Virginia and other earlier earthquakes in California, Washington, and other parts of the U.S., nonstructural failures have accounted for the majority of damage and injuries. In many cases, businesses, schools, hospitals, and other organizations had to spend excessive time and dollars for clean up and repair due to nonstructural failures; therefore impeding continued operations and rapid recovery. Moreover, nonstructural component failures also impeded safe evacuation, delayed rescue, and caused additional hazards such as fire resulting in serious life safety issues.</p>  <p>This FEMA-sponsored 1 ½ hour free webinar describes the sources and types of nonstructural earthquake damage and the effective methods and guidance that individuals and organizations can use to take action now before the next earthquake and minimize future injuries and property losses from nonstructural risks.</p>  <h5>Target Audience</h5>  <p>Building owners, facility managers, local officials, engineers, architects, small businesses, and emergency managers in the Pacific Northwest.</p>  <h5>Webinar Information</h5>  <p><strong>Time:</strong> 1:00 pm – 2:30 pm PST</p>  <p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday, February 14, 2012</p>  <p><strong>Webinar Link:</strong> <a href="https://fema.connectsolutions.com/nehrp-webinar/">https://fema.connectsolutions.com/nehrp-webinar/</a>    <br />If you have never used Adobe Connect Pro before, please test your connection prior to joining the webinar: <a href="https://fema.connectsolutions.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm">https://fema.connectsolutions.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm</a>.</p>  <p><strong>Audio:</strong> Dial 1 (888) 387-8686, Conference ID: 5416036    <br />Audio lines are limited to 300 participants only.
