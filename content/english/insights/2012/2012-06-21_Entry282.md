According to a commentary published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, storing harmful carbon dioxide gas underground is not practical. Why? Because it would cause earthquakes! </p>  <p>There is a long history of materials pumped underground causing earthquakes, and this report apparently finds this also likely in this situation. Although the quakes would likely be relatively small â€“ they would be large enough to destroy the equipment used to pump the greenhouse gases down. </p>  <p>Read more in the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-carbon-storage-may-cause-earthquakes-20120618,0,5073255.story" target="_blank">LA Times article</a>, which ends up quoting experts encouraging putting development funds into renewable energy instead. That makes sense to me!</p>
