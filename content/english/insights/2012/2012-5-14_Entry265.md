Consumers do not sign up for the free, location-based 90 character text messaging service - but if they wish can opt out of weather and AMBER alerts &ndash; but not presidential alerts. Alerts will be issued for tsunamis, extreme winds, ice storms, blizzards, and other life-threatening events &ndash; i.e., weather warnings &ndash; but not less severe weather watches.</p>

    <li>Urgency </li>

<p>WEA are not the same as text messages. WEA will not have to be opened like SMS text messages, but will &ldquo;pop up&rdquo; on the device&rsquo;s screen.&nbsp; A key differentiator between the CMAS/WEA capability and the existing Short Message Service Point-to-Point (SMS-PP)--a one-to-one or one-to-few alerting service--is that WEA uses SMS-Cell Broadcast (SMS-CB), a one-to-many service, which simultaneously delivers messages to multiple recipients in a specified area. By using SMS-CB as the delivery technology service, WEAs avoid the congestion issues currently experienced by traditional SMS-PP alerting services, which translates into faster and more comprehensive delivery of messages during times of emergency. &ndash; <a href="http://www.fema.gov/emergency/ipaws/cmas.shtm" target="_blank">WEA FAQ</a></p>

<ul>
    <li>In cooperation with wireless providers (AT&amp;T, Cellcom, Cricket, Sprint Nextel, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular and Verizon Wireless), the system should be implemented through the rest of the year nationwide. The Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) is the system interface to the WEA service. </li>
