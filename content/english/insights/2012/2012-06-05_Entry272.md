I’m a bit jaded about such marketing obviously, but it has generated LOTS of publicity and made many aware that otherwise wouldn’t have a clue.</p>  <p>So it is a good thing that Washington State will mount up to conduct our own version of this on October 18, 2012. Details and much more entertaining graphics should arrive soon, but you too can be in the know on this by going to our very own subsite at: <a title="http://www.shakeout.org/washington/" href="http://www.shakeout.org/washington/">www.shakeout.org/washington/</a>&#160;<em>Register Now!</em></p>
