<p><a href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazardimages/picture/show/1410" title="Just another scarey photo - or an incentive for preparation?"><img width="296" height="199" title="Just another scarey photo - or an incentive for preparation?" align="right" style="background-image: none;   margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right;   padding-top: 0px;border: 0px;" alt="Just another scarey photo - or an incentive for preparation?" src="/images/dnnBlog/1/244/Windows-Live-Writer-Scare-Tactics-428_A109-image_6.png" /></a>Some of our descriptions of potential disasters that might befall the Puget Sound region - and Vashon in particular - might sound a lot like crying &ldquo;Wolf&rdquo; to some. But there is a very serious reality out there, even if most of us haven&rsquo;t been exposed to it in our brief lives here on earth. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazardimages/picture/show/1617" title="Here's a tree bisected by a fault!"><img width="193" height="287" title="Here's a tree bisected by a fault!" align="left" style="background-image: none;   margin: 5px 5px 5px 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: left;   padding-top: 0px;border: 0px solid;" alt="Here's a tree bisected by a fault!" src="/images/dnnBlog/1/244/Windows-Live-Writer-Scare-Tactics-428_A109-image_5.png" /></a>The inspiration for this post is actually a treasure of images from around the world - of disasters. Maintained by NOAA&rsquo;s National Geophysical Data Center, the <a href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazardimages/" target="_blank">Natural Hazards Image Database</a> is a wealth of images we can use to learn from &ndash; and use to educate others about. Just another slew of scary photos - or are they incentives for individual preparation?</p>
<p>At VashonBePrepared, we&rsquo;re volunteers, not experts (though <a href="/Areyouready.aspx">we have some experts coming!</a>) at predicting the probabilities and real risks of these predicted disasters. We can point out and assemble some information on their effects, predictions from others, and point out tips for preparation. This way you can build a better picture (pun intended) of the true risks, and decide for your family and housing site what makes sense for you in terms of preparation.</p>
