<p><span style="font-weight: normal;"><img width="391" height="302" align="right" style="display: inline; float: right;" alt="Text VASHON to 22828 to sign up for emergency alrt emails from VashonBePrepared" src="/portals/1/Graphics/WebSite/Text22828.jpg" /></span>VashonBePrepared uses Constant Contact to manage several confidential email lists. These currently have many hundreds of users on them. The lists are free, and a great way to get the latest, authoritative information during an emergency.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: normal;">VashonBePrepared </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">Emergency Alerts</span></h2>
<p>One list is for anyone who would like to receive emergency alerts by email. This is a great way to receive authoritative information directly from Vashon Island Fire &amp; Rescue (VIFR) and/or VashonBePrepared during critical events affecting Vashon and Maury Island residents and businesses.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: normal;">Periodic VashonBePrepared Newsletter</span></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that we have sent out very many of these in recent years but it is likely that we will start sending out seasonal newsletters to those who sign up for this list.</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: normal;">Sign Up for King County Water Taxi Service Alerts</span></h2>
