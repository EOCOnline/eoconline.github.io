<p>Congrats to the variety of people (but especially Randall Bardwell<img style="display: inline; float: right" title="repeater1" alt="" align="right" src="http://www.wr7r.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/repeater1-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /> with assistance by Tim Hardy) for huge new progress on getting a second repeater up and (soon) operational for Vashon’s amateur radio community. While it will be able to serve as a backup to the existing <a href="http://www.w7vmi.org/" target="_blank">W7VMI club</a> repeater, it also is vastly more modern with a super flexible architecture that will allow a much broader array of services and modes in the future. This likely will play a role in enhancing emergency communications in coming years.</p>  <p>Rick Wallace was instrumental in coordinating the Sun rise Ridge board, Voice of Vashon PSE and Potelco to obtain permission and actually get the new antennas installed as shown to the right.</p>  <p>See all his photos, a video, and read more about the antenna installation that happened a week or so ago in Randy’s blog post: <a title="http://www.wr7r.com/?p=1143" href="http://www.wr7r.com/?p=1143">www.wr7r.com/?p=1143</a></p>
