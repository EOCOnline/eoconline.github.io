<p><img width="431" height="256" title="Figure 4: Drought over western North America from 800 to 2100. Reconstructed summer PDSI from 800 to 2006, five-year mean. Black rectangles show Stine no. 1 and Stine no. 2 megadroughts. Red circles denote five-year drought events as severe as the turn of the century event. Red line denotes the mean PDSI " align="right" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline; float: right;" alt="Drought over western North America from 800 to 2100." src="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v5/n8/carousel/ngeo1529-f4.jpg" />Western North America experienced the strongest drought in 800 years from 2000 to 2004 &ndash; but that may be the new normal for the next century. <em><a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v5/n8/pdf/ngeo1529.pdf" target="_blank">Reduction in carbon uptake during turn of the century drought in western North America &ndash; pg 551 &ndash; 556</a></em>, by a group of 10 researchers in the <a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v5/n8/index.html" target="_blank">current issue of Nature Geoscience</a>, looks at the reduced carbon uptake (by 51%) in drought stressed forests, based on a study of the 2000-2004 drought throughout western North America.</p>
<p>"Climatic extremes such as this will cause more large-scale droughts and forest mortality, and the ability of vegetation to sequester carbon is going to decline," study co-author Beverly Law of Oregon State University said in <a href="http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2012/07/30/North-America-may-face-megadrought/UPI-92241343679918/" target="_blank">UPI&rsquo;s story</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climate models predict that 80 out of the next 95 years will be just as dry as the 2000-2004 drought period,&rdquo; according to <a href="http://www.nwpr.org/post/study-megadrought-new-normal-west" target="_blank">KUOW&rsquo;s story</a> on this.</p>
<p>In a similar story, Environment America,&nbsp;released its report&nbsp;"<a href="http://www.environmentamerica.org/reports/ame/when-it-rains-it-pours">When it Rains, it Pours: Global Warming and the Increase in Extreme Precipitation from 1948 to 2011</a>" on Tuesday, which states extreme rain and snowstorms are more common. Reviewing data from some 65 years of weather history, they&nbsp;see a 30% increase in extreme storm frequency. Counter intuitively this doesn't conflict with the other report of more droughts: the storms appear at other locatins and times of the year unfortunately. News of this comes&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-205_162-57483494/extreme-storms-30-percent-more-common-now-than-in-1948/" target="_blank">from CBS News</a> too.</p>
