Yep, FEMA apparently hired them to start educating tots early – in a variety of languages too. Fun! (I wish I had received that contract.)</p>  <p>Today I noticed that Washington State has developed some tsunami and earthquake games too. Educating kids is certainly an exciting new genre – full of possibility! </p>  <p>See more about these <a href="/AreyouReady/Residents/Kids-RUReady.aspx" target="_blank">on VashonBePrepared’s own kid-friendly disaster page</a>. (We’ll try to get some moving pictures, sound &amp; interactive widgets on there soon…)</p>
