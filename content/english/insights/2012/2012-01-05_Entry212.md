<p><em>What a great new goal for Vashon businesses in 2012!</em> </p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) has just released the <a href="http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&amp;enid=ZWFzPTEmbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTIwMTA0LjQ3OTk4NDEmbWVzc2FnZWlkPU1EQi1QUkQtQlVMLTIwMTIwMTA0LjQ3OTk4NDEmZGF0YWJhc2VpZD0xMDAxJnNlcmlhbD0xNjgwNTIxMCZlbWFpbGlkPWZlbWEtbWl0aWdhdGlvbkB2YXNob25kZXNpZ24uY29tJnVzZXJpZD1mZW1hLW1pdGlnYXRpb25AdmFzaG9uZGVzaWduLmNvbSZmbD0mZXh0cmE9TXVsdGl2YXJpYXRlSWQ9JiYm&amp;&amp;&amp;100&amp;&amp;&amp;http://www.fema.gov/plan/prevent/earthquake/qstoolkit/index.shtm">FEMA P-811 CD:&nbsp; Earthquake Publications for Businesses (QuakeSmart Toolkit)</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img width="238" height="300" title="Calexico, CA, April 7, 2010&mdash;A magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck this market leaving a trail of broken merchandise and products throughout the store. Had the store taken proper mitigation steps such as using straps to keep products in place, damages would have been minimized (Photo by Adam DuBrowa/FEMA)." align="right" style="background-image: none;   margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; float: right;   padding-top: 0px;border: 0px;" alt="Calexico, CA, April 7, 2010&mdash;A magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck this market leaving a trail of broken merchandise and products throughout the store. Had the store taken proper mitigation steps such as using straps to keep products in place, damages would have been minimized (Photo by Adam DuBrowa/FEMA)." src="http://www.fema.gov/plan/prevent/earthquake/qstoolkit/images/damage2.jpg" />Thousands of earthquakes occur in the United States each year; most are too small to significantly affect businesses and communities. However, large and very damaging earthquakes have occurred in the past and could happen again at anytime.&nbsp; In general, many businesses have invested in emergency management and continuity of operations planning. However, most businesses have not conducted earthquake mitigation measures to protect their assets, staff, and business operations. During an earthquake, buildings&mdash;or their components or contents&mdash;can be collapsed, toppled, broken apart, tossed around, or rendered inoperable or unusable.</p>
<p>Therefore, as part of addressing all-hazards emergency management, it is critical for businesses to also incorporate actionable <em><b>earthquake mitigation</b></em> solutions into their planning and business decisions.&nbsp; By doing so, businesses protect the organization&rsquo;s assets (people, property, operations); sustain the capability to provide goods and/or services to the community; maintain cash flow; preserve competitive advantage and reputation; and provide the ability to meet legal, regulatory, financial and contractual obligations.</p>
<p>This QuakeSmart Toolkit (FEMA P-811CD) provides business owners, managers, and employees with basic guidance and ready-to-use tools that can be tailored to the specific needs and requirements of the user. The guidance and tools focus on the importance of earthquake mitigation and the <em><b>simple</b></em> things they can do to reduce the potential of earthquake damages, injuries, and financial losses at work&hellip;AND also at home and within their communities.</p>
