Alex Johnson of msnbc.com also reports on <a href="/News/Blogs/VashonPreparedness/tabid/164/EntryId/225/Cascadia-Mega-Quake-Threat-Even-Larger-than-Previously-Thought.aspx">last month&rsquo;s reports</a> at the American Association for the Advancement of Science &ndash; noting that the Cascadia quake has numerous parallels with Japan&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami">Tōhoku disaster</a> one year ago.</p>
<p>At that conference, the University of Nevada-Reno&rsquo;s <a href="http://aaas.confex.com/aaas/2012/webprogram/Paper7162.html">John Anderson</a>, said that the Cascadia fault line poses the greater threat of unleashing a killer mega-quake than the San Andreas fault running through California. Based on analysis of last year&rsquo;s quake, researchers say a Cascadia event, if deep, could result in more damaging shacking than what happened in Japan.</p>
<p>According to the msnbc story,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The warnings come as the White House is proposing a 2013 budget that would cut $4.6 million from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's tsunami programs. Much of that would come from the <a href="http://nthmp.tsunami.gov/">National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program</a>, which funds evacuation maps, training and education efforts &mdash; important services given how deeply the Japanese quake and tsunami transformed the science of seismology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/07/10602802-quake-experts-upgrade-their-alerts">another MSNBC story</a>, California&rsquo;s Earthquake Early Warning network or <a href="http://seismo.berkeley.edu/annual_report/ar09_10/node22.html">ShakeAlert</a> &ndash; once refined - could provide maybe 30 seconds advance warning of a quake, but funding for the $80 million required for the southern system is very uncertain &ndash; much less the $70 million for a northwest early warning earthquake network.</p>
