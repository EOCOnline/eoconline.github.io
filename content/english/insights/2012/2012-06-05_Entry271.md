They don’t crow about it much, but they are fairly consistently busy apparently with some 4372 state-wide incidents to track last year! They only activated 14 times, but obviously spent a lot of time tracking activities throughout the state, but especially olde King County – with 865 of those 4372 incidents: 670 of our county’s incidents were Hazmat, 121 Search &amp; Rescue, 73 Other &amp; 1 Fire incident.</p>  <p>The EMD also organizes training program state-wide, exercises &amp; drills, business &amp; citizen education and probably a bit of accounting/administration too.
