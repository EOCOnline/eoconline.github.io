<p>The <strong>E</strong>mergency <strong>O</strong>perations <strong>C</strong>enter wants you!&nbsp;&nbsp;What is that and why do they want me, you ask?&nbsp; Scenario: So, the big one hits -&nbsp;but you and your family were ready.&nbsp; You have enough food and water for yourselves and your animals to last easily for 10 days and you've called your designated out-of-state contact and let them know you and your family are okay.&nbsp; Your house&nbsp;is strapped to its foundation and&nbsp;your water heater&nbsp;and shelves are still securely&nbsp;bracketed to the walls and clean up&nbsp;is a breeze.&nbsp; You've still got major adrenilin in your system and you're looking around at the homes of friends and neighbors and realizing that there is a mountain of work to do to get the island back on its feet - and you are ready!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Vashon's <strong>EOC</strong> will need many volunteers to help run every aspect of island recovery from the moment a major event occurs until every member of our island family has food, clothing and permanent shelter. </p>
<p>So, what can you do? Start with what you are good at! If you&nbsp;are well prepared for a disaster then you are good at <strong>planning</strong>.&nbsp; You can join the <strong>Planning&nbsp;Team</strong> and help bring everything that islanders will need here and have it ready to support this community.</p>
<p>Are you good at organization?&nbsp; Then the <strong>Logistics&nbsp;Team</strong> needs you!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Good with people?&nbsp; Then the <strong>Public Relations Team</strong> could use your help!</p>
<p>So, you're a great communicator? </p>
<p>Do you want to be ready to jump right in and help rescue people who are trapped or need help?&nbsp; Then you are perfect for the <strong>CERT Team</strong>.</p>
