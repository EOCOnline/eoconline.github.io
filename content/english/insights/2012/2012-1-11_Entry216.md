It is too early to not consequences for these and the discovery doesn&rsquo;t inherently up the likelihood for quakes, but will make future predictions more accurate and does expand our understanding of the mechanisms at work underground &ndash; where real faults are much more complex than simple two dimensional lines on a map.
