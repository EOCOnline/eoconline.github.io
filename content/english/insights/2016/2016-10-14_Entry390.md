<p><img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; display: inline" alt="	Woman cleaning inside of home after a storm." src="http://www.cdc.gov/disasters/hurricanes/images/woman-cleaning210x155px.jpg" width="350" align="right" height="258" />Most homes on Vashon are well built against the seasonal rains and water we face. Still, if a drain clogs, or the incoming rain is heavier than the system can take you may still wind up with a flooded basement or other area of your home.</p>  <p>FEMA has a number of guidelines borne of experience for how homeowners can handle floods. Although focused on floods from Hurricane Mathew out east, many of the same guidelines apply to floods that may occur on Vashon.</p>  <p>Check out <a href="http://www.phe.gov/emergency/events/hurricanematthew/Pages/cleanup.aspx" target="_blank">FEMAâ€™s flood clean-up guidelines here</a>.</p>
